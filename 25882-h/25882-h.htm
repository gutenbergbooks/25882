<h2>A VENETIAN CRUISER.</h2>
</div>

<p>It was late in the year 1431. The port
of Venice was filled with ships from all
parts of the world, bringing to her their
choicest stores, and their most costly merchandise,
and receiving from her and from
her Grecian possessions rich shiploads of
wine and spices, and bales of finest cotton.
</p>
<p>It would have been a sight never to have
been forgotten could we have gazed then on
that city of the sea, have watched the cumbrous
barks, so unlike our light-winged
merchant ships, or our swift steamers, which
sailed heavily up and down the blue Adriatic,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
till they came in sight of the famous
city, the resort of all nations, in whose
canals, and among whose marts and palaces,
might be seen the strange dress, and heard
the mingled speech of men from all parts
of the civilized world.
</p>
<p>One ship was just leaving the port. The
vessel, rather a large one for those days,
seems but poorly manned, and rocks so
greatly among the short white waves, that
it is plainly to be seen that she is short of
ballast and lading. She is a Venetian trading
vessel, bound first to the Isle of Candia,
where she will complete her cargo and
add to the number of her crew. This Candia
or Crete (the very Crete by which St.
Paul passed on his voyage to Italy) was at
that time under the hard rule of Venice,
and its poor inhabitants did her service
upon land and sea. The ship stayed at
Candia only so long as enabled her to complete
her stores of cotton and spice and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
wine, which were destined for some northern
or western market, some French or British
port. She was deep enough in the
water now, and on her deck lay many an
unstowed bale, many a cask of wine, for
which the sad-looking Cretan sailors, in
their tunics and short cloaks, had not yet
been able to find room. Sixty-eight men
were now on board, including the patron or
owner, Master Piero Quirini, and Christoforo
Fioravanti, the sailing-master. Quirini, in
his quaint Italian dress, looking strangely unlike
a modern sailor, stood amid the piles of
merchandise, giving quick orders for its
stowage, while the sailing master made all
ready for the long voyage which was just
beginning.
</p>
<p>For in those days a voyage into the western
sea was counted, specially while boisterous
autumn gales made sailing difficult,
as a long and hazardous undertaking. They
all knew it must be many months ere they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
could hope to see home again; but little did
any of them guess the strange sad fortunes
which should befall them. The Cretan sailors
looked back wistfully at the groups of
their friends, their wives and mothers and
children, whom they had left weeping on
the shore, but they did not think how many
there were among them who would never
return to tell the story of their long voyage.
But some at least among them knew and felt
that they were in the hands of God for life
or for death, and that nothing could really
hurt them if they were &#8220;followers of that
which is good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ship at first sailed on prosperously
enough. The sea was calm, and the sky
clear above them. The sailors sang their
sweet Italian or Grecian songs, as they
hurried to and fro, or leant over the bulwarks,
watching the blue water.
</p>
<p>Their course lay northward now, and wind
and wave were sweeping them toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
perilous northern seas. The days had been
already growing short when the ship left
Candia, and now December, with its cold
and darkness, was upon them, and these
southern sailors shivered as they met the
keen northern blasts.
</p>
<p>The cold grew sharper than ever on one
night toward the end of the year, but on
that very night Master Piero Quirini chose
to remain on deck, braving the winter wind,
instead of taking shelter in his warm and
comfortable cabin below. He stood looking
eastward with his keen eyes, his hand shading
his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come hither, Fioravanti,&#8221; he called, and
the sailing-master approached. &#8220;There is
a strange appearance in the sky which
affrights me; I fear a sudden, and violent
storm, and then what will befall our ship,
thus heavily laden?&#8221; said Quirini.
</p>
<p>The old sailor turned towards the part of
the horizon which Quirini had pointed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
out; and as he looked, his face changed.
&#8220;Quick,&#8221; said he, calling to the sailors
who were nearest, &#8220;bid them draw in the
sails. Let the rudder be bound firmly, for
the tempest is well nigh on us&mdash;alas! for
these terrible northern storms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before he had well finished speaking, his
Italian sailors had begun their work, the
slower and more apathetic Greeks needing,
even in that moment of danger, to be urged
with many words before they would obey.
Thus it was but slowly that the heavy sails,
creaking and swaying in the wind, were
drawn in and bound to the masts, and
before half the work was done, the storm
in its full fury had struck the ship, and
each man clung for life to the nearest support,
as the reeling vessel ploughed heavily
through the swollen seas.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, the rudder is gone, the rudder
is lost,&#8221; cried many voices, as after a sudden
lurch forward the ship righted again,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
and as they cried out, a fresh blast struck
her, and the half-furled sails were torn into
ribbons, and hung useless over the ship&#8217;s
side.
</p>
<p>The morning light found her still driving
before the wind, and deep in the sullen
water which rose almost above her sides as
she flew faster than ever before the fierce
wind. At length a sudden squall threw her
on her side, while the waters rushed in as
if to fill and sink her in a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, men! an axe, an axe!&#8221; cried the
master; &#8220;down with the main-mast!&#8221; and
seizing a hatchet which lay at hand, Piero
Quirini struck the first blow at the tall
mast, whose weight was dragging down the
vessel. Others with sword, or axe, or any
tool which they could snatch at the moment,
followed, and they were but just in time,
for before another wave could wash over the
vessel, the mast was floating free, and the
ship had righted once more. The water was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
baled out with every vessel on which the
men could lay their hands; and this weary
work was continued all through the cold
dark night, yet when the morning broke
hours behind its time, as it seemed to the
despairing sailors, the water in the hold was
scarcely three inches lower.
</p>
<p>The only hope for the crew lay in taking
at once to their boats. There were two
boats belonging to the ship&mdash;the pinnace
and the skiff; the first was a long boat, but
the skiff, which was considered the safer of
the two, would hold but a smaller number.
</p>
<p>The master called the men round him on
the deck, and told them his decision. &#8220;Now,
men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you shall choose your boat;
there stands the notary, Nicolo di Michiel,
with his ink-horn and parchment; he shall
write down the names of all who would fain
sail in the skiff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, there are forty-five for the
skiff,&#8221; said Nicolo, slowly reckoning the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
long list of written names; &#8220;forty-five, and
the skiff, saith Christoforo Fioravanti, holds
but twenty-one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Draw lots, men, we are brothers now in
trouble, and none shall have advantage over
the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lots were drawn, and then the master
proceeded to divide between the two crews
the stores of the fast-sinking ship. Bread,
cheese, bacon, tallow and oil, and a little wine,
as much as she could carry, were given to the
crew of the skiff, while the master, with
forty-six men, stored in the pinnace what
remained on board, and one by one the
men passed over the ship&#8217;s side, and the
boats dropped off into the wide sea.
</p>
<p>It was calm, the terrible wind had sunk
down, and the keen wintry sky was clear
once more, but yet the prospect before them
was enough to trouble the bravest heart.
</p>
<p>They were adrift in the bitter cold in
open boats, but ill-supplied for a long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
voyage, and were, as they believed, five hundred
miles from the nearest shore. All
night a heavy mist hung over them, and
when it was dispersed by the morning sun
the crew of the pinnace looked round in
vain for their companions,&mdash;the skiff was
nowhere to be seen.
</p>
<p>Six days had passed, and all hope of seeing
their companion boat had grown faint,
when another storm arose, and the pinnace,
heavily laden, shipped so much water over
the sides that all feared she would sink.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mens&#8217; lives before wines and spices!
precious and costly though they be,&#8221; said
the master; &#8220;we must lighten the boat of
all, save a little needful food and water;
linger not, my children, therein lies our
only hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the days went on, and though the
storm passed, and the pinnace still rode
safely on the waters, the hearts of the crew
were heavy within them. The boat was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
indeed lighter now, for of the forty-seven who
had embarked in her, twenty-six died, and
their bodies had been solemnly committed
to the deep, there to wait till, at the voice
of God&#8217;s angel, the sea shall give up her
dead. Solemn indeed must have been the
thoughts of the survivors as they saw one
after another of their comrades summoned
from their side to stand before God; no one
of them knew but that he might be called
next, and all were sure that if help did not
reach them speedily, none would return
home to tell the tale of their sufferings.
Some there were of that crew who, faint,
weary, in want of covering, tortured with
thirst, yet held fast their trust in their
Father in Heaven, and cried to Him with
agonized prayer to have mercy on them for
Christ&#8217;s sake. And the prayer for deliverance
was heard.
</p>
<p>It was on the third of January, and the
first faint daylight was stealing over the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
waters, when one of the crew, looking
eagerly round as he raised himself from
uneasy sleep, saw far off a faint line which
seemed to be land. The sun rose higher
and colored rose-red the snow-hooded tops
of lofty rocks around the unknown coast.
All the hope and desire of the shipwrecked
crew was now to reach this shore, fearing
its unknown dangers but little, compared
with the terrible suffering they had long
endured.
</p>
<p>But, alas! the wind had died away, and
in vain did they unfurl their sails, and set
their rudder. They must try the oars then,
but the arms of the starving sailors were
too weak to move the boat, and they could
do nothing but trust to the force of the
waves and the currents which were bearing
her along. It was the sixth of January
when they reached the land, and with great
difficulty drew their boat to the beach.
They soon found that they had landed on an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
uninhabited island, which lay, as they afterwards
found, off the coast of Norway&mdash;a
strange and foreign land to the Venetians
of those days.
</p>
<p>No sooner did the wasted remnant of the
crew set foot on shore than they rushed to
the rocks, climbing them with strength
which they had not thought they possessed,
and eagerly gathering the pure white snow
in their hands, bathed their parched lips
and dry tongues, drinking again and again,
as if they could never taste enough of this
delicious draught.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, men, draw the boat higher on
shore, ere the tide go out and float her
away,&#8221; said the master; but when the pinnace
was drawn to the dry sand she was
found to be so battered and so full of holes,
that they all saw at once that it was useless
to hope that they could ever put to sea in
her again. &#8220;We will make her serve for
a shelter at least,&#8221; said Christoforo, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
so, dividing her into two parts, they, with
the help of her sails, made two huts, in
which the twenty-one sailors, who alone
were left, might find some slight shelter
from the winter wind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our thirst have we slaked,&#8221; said Nicolo,
&#8220;and said grace, I trust, for the draught;
now, by your leave, good master, must we
seek for food, though what food this barren
island should afford, I know not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All the party dispersed at once in search
of provisions, some climbing the rocks,
some wandering along the beach, and some
seeking to penetrate farther inland. Returning
towards evening slowly and sadly to
the huts, they examined the store that had
been found&mdash;a few periwinkles and barnacles
and some other small shell-fish, but a poor
feast for so many famished men. Their
search, continued far and wide over the
island, discovered no other food, save a
kind of small herb which grew under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
snow. This they ate day after day, and so
were able to keep a little life in them
though they were always faint and hungry.
</p>
<p>Five out of the little colony were already
dead from cold and hunger and exhaustion,
when one day a sailor wandering farther than
he had yet been, came upon a little hut,
empty and deserted, but giving a better and
more comfortable shelter than their sail-covered
huts.
</p>
<p>Six of the company determined to live in
this new home, thinking that the chances of
finding food for the whole would be increased
when they were more widely scattered on
the island. And scarcely had they taken
up their abode in their new quarters, when
they were overjoyed by finding on the
beach, close at hand, a large dead fish.
They did not know whether it was a whale
or a porpoise, but they saw that it was quite
fresh and fit for food, and every one of
them believed that God had sent this great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
deliverance in answer to their prayers for
help. All hands turned out to drag the
fish to their hut, and no sooner was it safely
housed than a terrible storm broke over the
island, which lasted nine days. So fierce
was the wind, so pitiless the tempest, that
during all that time not one of the sailors
dare set foot outside the cottage, and had it
not been for the merciful provision which
God had bidden the waves to bring to them,
they must all have perished with hunger.
</p>
<p>The fish was at length eaten, not a fin,
nor a morsel of flesh remained, and once
more the sailors were forced to seek along
the shore for shell-fish, which was now their
only food. Christoforo was one day seated
in the cottage. He had grown white and
thin, and his long lank hair looked dry and
rusty, as it hung over his sunken cheeks.
He was gazing listlessly on the dull sea,
and on the distant, cloud-like lines which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
told of other islands, or may be of the main
land far off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only reach those shores,&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;may be men dwell thereon,
and we might find food. But we have
neither boat nor wood whereof to make one,
neither have we strength to row, so seemeth
there no choice but we must all perish here;
the will of God be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Raising his eyes, which had sunk while
he pursued these sad thoughts, he suddenly
sprang to his feet, and with a glad shout
cried, &#8220;Rejoice, behold two come to seek
us,&#8221; and as he spoke, his companions, looking
out, saw two shepherd lads climbing the
hill-side.
</p>
<p>The strangers turned and fled in terror at
the sight of man on this lonely island, and
the sailors following to the shore found
there a little boat in charge of an old man.
They had learnt some prudence now, and
they approached quietly, making signs of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
good-will and of humility, and asking by
look and gesture his pity on their great
distress. The two lads soon came down
and joined their father, and though none of
the three could understand a word of the
Italian speech, it chanced that there was
one among the sailors, Girado da Lione by
name, who had learnt a few words of Norwegian,
and by means of this interpreter
they managed to tell the visitors of their
terrible needs.
</p>
<p>The little boat would hold but two besides
its owners, and Girado da Lione and Bernardo
the pilot were chosen to accompany
the shepherds to their home, and to get help
to bring off all who remained of the shipwrecked
crew. On their way they questioned
the shepherd, as well as they could,
on the cause of his journey to the island.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A strange reason was it, truly, my
friends,&#8221; answered the old man, &#8220;but my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
son can tell you better than I. Speak, my
son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The younger of the two oarsmen, a lad of
about sixteen, answered bashfully: &#8220;It was
a dream, strangers, that led our boat to that
shore. My father had lost two heifers,
white were they, with black stars on their
forehead and there were none like them in
the island where we dwell. Long did we
seek our missing kine, and great was our
sorrow when we found them not; but last
night I dreamed that I saw them feeding
upon this island, the cliffs of which we can
sometimes see from our home. When I
awakened I persuaded my father to take the
boat and let us row to the island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We found not our heifers,&#8221; said the old
fisherman, smiling, &#8220;but, thank the good
God, we found men. Doubtless it was God
who sent my son this dream, that so we
might be in time to save you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were soon received by a crowd of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
eager peasants, who crowded down to the
beach, when the story of the rescue spread.
They were in another island now, far larger,
and moreover cultivated and inhabited, and
food was given them, and shelter offered,
and clean clothes brought to replace their
own ragged and dirty garments. But of
course the first anxiety of the two rescued
sailors was to send relief to their companions
at the hut, and to those who might yet
remain alive on the other side of the island.
The kind islanders prepared quite a fleet of
little boats in which to hasten to the rescue
of these poor deserted men, but at the huts
which they had first built, only five were
found alive, and their new friends prepared
with sad hearts to bury the dead as well as
to save the living.
</p>
<p>The eleven survivors grasped each other&#8217;s
hands with feeling too deep for words; they
the only ones left of the sixty-eight who,
in full health and strength, had left the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
shores of Candia. &#8220;Truly,&#8221; said one, &#8220;we
had been swallowed up of the sea, if our
Lord Jesus Christ had not been merciful to
us, who forsaketh not them that religiously
call upon Him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we must part,&#8221; said they among
themselves, &#8220;and seek our way to Venice
on foot or by sea, as we may find means.
Sad news bring we thither, and many heavy
hearts must we make. But God has spared
us to our dear ones, and let us few that
remain remember that we live only to commend
to memory, and highly to exalt, the
great power of God.&#8221;

<h2>A WINTER IN THE NORTHERN SEAS;<br />OR,<br />CAPTAIN JAMES'S JOURNAL.</h2>
</div>

<p>The following passages are taken from
the journal kept by Captain James, the commander
of a vessel bound for the northern
seas. His ship, having on board a crew of
twenty-two men, left England in May, 1631,
to attempt the discovery of the long-desired
North-West Passage. After terrible storms
and disasters, the ship being fast-locked in ice
the adventurers were compelled to winter
in the Arctic regions; and, as the journal
relates, proceeded to make preparations for
passing the long months on an uninhabited
island near to the ship. The extracts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
from the diary tell the story of those
months, speaking in words which need no
comment, of high hope, of constant courage,
and of a sincere and true-hearted dependence
on God. Throughout all the disappointments
and perils of his expedition,
Captain James seems ever to have kept alive
trust in God, and a sure belief that all
that could befall him and his, would be
directed by an All-wise hand; thus his heart
did not fail even in the midst of overwhelming
perils and disasters.
</p>
<p>These brave men were not ashamed to own
their entire dependence on God&#8217;s help, and
we find here, as elsewhere, that it is ever
the strongest who best know their own
weakness&mdash;that the noblest are ever the
most humble, the most ready to acknowledge
the Divine Source of all their courage.
</p>
<p>And the heroes whom English boys love
to remember, and desire to imitate, have, in
proportion as they were true heroes, unselfish,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
generous, brave, been also the most true
and faithful servants of that God who is the
source of all strength, all love, all tenderness
and truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oct. 7.&mdash;It snowed all day, so that we
had to clear it off the decks with shovels,
and it blew a very storm withal. The sun
did shine very clear, and we tore the topsails
out of the tops, which were hard frozen
in them into a lump, the sun not having power
to thaw one drop of them. Seeing therefore
that we could no longer make use of
our sails, it raised many doubts in our minds
that here we must stay and winter. The sick
men desired that some little house or hovel
might be built ashore, whereby they might
be the better sheltered. I took the carpenter,
and choosing out a place, they went immediately
to work upon it, while I myself wandered
up and down in the woods to see if
we could discover any signs of savages, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
we found no appearance of any on this
island.
</p>
<p>Oct. 12.&mdash;We took our mainsail, which
was hard frozen, and carried it ashore to
cover our house, first thawing it by a great
fire; by night they had covered it, and had
almost hedged it about, and our six builders
desired they might travel up into the country
to see what they could discover.
</p>
<p>Oct. 15.&mdash;This evening our hunters returned
very weary, and brought with them
a small, lean deer, which rejoiced us all,
hoping we should have more of them to
refresh our sick.
</p>
<p>Nov. 10.&mdash;I urged the men to make
traps to catch foxes, for we did daily see
many, and I promised that whosoever could
take one of them should have the skin for
his reward.
</p>
<p>Nov. 17.&mdash;I have lain ashore each night
until now, all which time have our miseries
increased; and, looking from the shore
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
towards the ship, she doth look like a piece
of ice in the fashion of a ship; the snow is
frozen all about her, and all her forepart is
firm ice.
</p>
<p>Nov. 25.&mdash;The wind shifted easterly, and
we encouraged one another, and to work we
go, our endeavor being to put the ship
to the shore. This evening we broke through
the ice, and put an anchor to keep her to
shore if possible. Here Sir Hugh Willoughby
came into my mind, who without
doubt was driven out of his harbor in this
manner, and so starved at sea. But God
was more merciful to us.
</p>
<p>Nov. 20.&mdash;I resolved, for the greater
safety of the ship, to sink her right down,
but she would not sink so fast as we would
have her. At noon-day the water rose and
beat the bulk-heads of the bread-room, powder-room,
and forepiece, all to pieces; thus
she continued till three, and then the sea
came up on the upper deck, and soon after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
she began to settle. We were seventeen
poor souls now in the boat, and we now
imagined that we had leaped out of the
frying-pan into the fire, for we thought
assuredly the ebb would carry us away into
the sea. We therefore doubled-manned four
oars, and so, with the help of God, we got
to the shore. Being there arrived, we
greeted our fellows the best we could; at
which time they could not know us, nor we
them by our habits nor voices, so frozen all
over we were, faces, hair, and apparel. I
comforted them the best I could, saying,
&#8220;My masters and faithful companions, be
not dismayed for any of these disasters, but
let us put our whole trust in God; it is He
that giveth and He that taketh away. His
will be done. If it be our fortunes to end
our days here, we are as near heaven as in
England, and we are much bound to God
Almighty for giving us so large a time of
repentance. I make no doubt but He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
will be merciful to us both here on earth,
and in His blessed kingdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dec. 1.&mdash;To-day it is so cold that firm
ice has formed over the boat-track, and we
can reach the ship on foot; we have brought
over on our backs five hundred fish, and
much of our bedding and clothes, which we
had to dig out of the ice.
</p>
<p>Dec. 10.&mdash;We have been busied this past
week, save on Sunday, when we rested and
performed the Sabbath duties of a Christian,
in bringing hither stores from the ship&mdash;now
bearing them over firm ice, and now
wading knee-deep in half-frozen water. I
will here describe the house which we have
built to shelter us withal. It is among a
tuft of thick trees, under a south bank, about
a bow-shot from the seaside; it is square,
and about twenty feet every way. First we
drove strong stakes into the earth round
about, which we wattled with boughs as
thick as might be, beating them down very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
close. At the ends we left two holes for
the light to come in at, and the same way
the smoke did pass out also. Then we cut
down trees into lengths of six feet, with
which we made a pile on both sides. We
left a little low door to creep into, and a
porch was before that, made with piles of
wood. We next fastened a rough tree aloft
over all, upon which we laid our rafters and
our roof. On the inside, we made fast our
sails round about. Now have we driven in
stakes and made us bedstead frames, about
three sides of the house. We have made
our hearth in the middle of the house, and
on it our fire. This house we propose to
call our mansion, as we have built two
smaller near by for our kitchen and our
store-house.
</p>
<p>Dec. 31.&mdash;Our mansion is now covered
thick with snow, almost to the very roof of
it; we do not go out save we first shovel
away the snow, and then by treading, make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
it somewhat hard under foot. We have got
our boat ashore, and fetched up some of our
provisions from the beach, with extremity of
cold and labor; and thus we concluded the
old year 1631.
</p>
<p>Jan. 2, 1632.&mdash;I observed the sun to rise
like an oval along the horizon; I called
three or four to see it, the better to confirm
my judgment; and we all agreed that it was
twice as long as it was broad. We plainly
perceived withal, that by degrees as it rose
higher it also recovered its soundness.
</p>
<p>Jan. 30.&mdash;But little worthy the writing
has happened to us this month. The men
grow daily weaker, and our stores less. We
have three sorts of sick men&mdash;those that
cannot move nor turn themselves in their
beds, who must be tended like infants;
those that are as it were crippled; and
those that are something better, but afflicted
with sore mouths. These last make shift to
work; they go to work through the snow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
to the ship, and about their other business.
Our cook doth order our food in this manner.
The beef which is to serve on Sunday
night to supper, he doth boil on Saturday
night in a kettle full of water, with a quart
of oatmeal, about an hour. Then taking the
beef out, he doth boil the rest till it is
thick, which we call porridge, which, with
bread, we do eat as hot as we may; and
after this we have fish, and thus we have
some warm thing every supper.
</p>
<p>But many of our sick eat nought save a
little oatmeal or pease. Hitherto we have
taken but a dozen foxes in all our traps.
</p>
<p>Feb. 10.&mdash;The cold is as extreme just
now as at any time this year, and many of
our men complain heavily of sickness; two-thirds
of our company are under the surgeon&#8217;s
hand. And yet, nevertheless, they
must work daily, and go abroad to fetch
wood and timber notwithstanding the most
of them have no shoes to put on. Their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
shoes, upon their coming to the fire out of
the snow, were burnt and scorched upon
their feet, and they were forced to bind
old clothes about their feet. Our clock and
watch, though we have kept them ever by
the fireside, yet they are so frozen that they
cannot go. The inside of our house is
hanged with icicles, and many a time when
I put my hand into the brass kettle by the
fire, I find one side very warm, and the
other side an inch frozen.
</p>
<p>Mar. 15.&mdash;One of our men thinks that he
has seen a deer, whereupon he with two or
three more desire that they may go and see
if they can take it, and I have given them
leave.
</p>
<p>Mar. 16.&mdash;Last evening did our hunters
return, not having seen the deer, but so
disabled with cold, that they will not be
well in a fortnight.

Return of the Hunters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 40.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Mar. 31.&mdash;Our carpenter is now among
our sick, his cutting tools are but few, and
these mostly broken and bound about with
rope-yarn as fast as may be. Thus our pinnace,
on which lyeth so much of our hope
of escape, is but in an indifferent forwardness.
</p>
<p>April 4.&mdash;To-day we have been sitting
all about the fire, reasoning and considering
together about our estate. The time and
season of the year comes forward apace, and
we have determined on this course. With
the first warm weather we will begin to
clear the ship from the ice and water, so
that should the pinnace never be finished,
as seemeth in doubt through the sickness of
our carpenter, we might yet have some hope
in our old ship to complete our enterprise,
and to return home.
</p>
<p>April 6.&mdash;This day is the deepest snow
we have had all this year; it hath filled up
all our paths and ways.
</p>
<p>April 16.&mdash;This is the most comfortable
sunshine that hath come this year, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
have put some to clear off the snow from
the upper decks of the ship, and to clear
and dry the great cabin by making fire in
it. Others have I put to dig down through
the ice to come by our anchor.
</p>
<p>April 25.&mdash;Now have we labored so hard
that we are mightily encouraged, for the
water doth rise without the ship, and yet
doth not make its way into the hold. I
have bid the cook that he pour hot water
into the pumps, and so thaw them.
</p>
<p>April 27.&mdash;One of the pumps is cleared,
and by means of this we have drawn two
feet of water from the hold, and we find
to our satisfaction that it doth not rise again.
</p>
<p>May 2.&mdash;It doth snow and blow so that
we must keep house all day; our sick men
are so grieved at this unexpected cold that
they grow worse and worse.
</p>
<p>May 3.&mdash;To-day some of the snow melted
on the land, and some cranes and geese have
come to it. I and the surgeon have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
with a couple of fowling-pieces to see if we
could kill any for our sick men, but never
did I see such wild-fowl; they would not
endure to see anything move, therefore we
have been obliged to return empty-handed
and wearied.
</p>
<p>May 9.&mdash;We have at last come to and
got up our five barrels of beef and pork
which were sunk in the hold, and we have
also found four butts of beer, which will be
as a cordial to our sick men. God make
us ever thankful for the comforts that He
gives us!
</p>
<p>May 13.&mdash;This is the Sabbath day, which
we have solemnized, giving God thanks for
those hopes and comforts which we daily
have.
</p>
<p>May 21.&mdash;This is the warmest day we
have yet had. Two of my men have I sent
a fowling, and myself, the master, the surgeon,
and one more with our guns and our
dogs, have been into the woods to see what
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
comfort we could find. We have wandered
full eight miles from the house, and have
searched with all diligence, but returned
comfortless; not an herb, no leaf eatable,
that we could find. Our fowlers have had as
bad success. The snow is by this time
pretty well wasted in the woods. We have
a high tree on the highest part of the island
which we call our watch-tree, and from the
top thereof we can see far over the seas,
but we find no appearance of breaking up
yet.
</p>
<p>May 24.&mdash;Very warm sunshine. The
ice doth consume by the shore side, and
cracks all over the bay with a fearful noise.
This morning I sent two to search for the
ship&#8217;s rudder, which was buried among the
ice, and a fortunate fellow, one David
Hammon, pecking between the broken blocks,
struck upon it, who crying out that he had
found it, the rest came and got it up on
the ice, and so into the ship. O, this was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
a joyful day to us all; and we gave God
thanks for the hopes we had of it.
</p>
<p>May 31.&mdash;We have found some vetches
on the beach, which I have made the men
pick up, and boil for their sick comrades.
</p>
<p>June 4.&mdash;These four days hath it snowed,
hailed, and blown hard; and it hath been
so cold that the water in our cans did freeze
in the very house, our clothes also, that had
been washed and hung out to dry, did not
thaw all day.
</p>
<p>June 15.&mdash;This day I went to our watch-tree,
but the sea was still firm and frozen,
and the bay we were in was full of ice.
</p>
<p>June 16.&mdash;Here have there lately appeared
divers sorts of flies, and such an
abundance of mosquitoes, that we are more
tormented with them than ever we were
with the cold weather. Here be likewise
ants, and frogs in the ponds upon the land,
but we durst not eat of them, they looked
so speckled like toads. By this time there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
are neither bears, foxes, nor fowl, to be
seen; they are all gone.
</p>
<p>June 17.&mdash;At high water we did heave
our ship with such good-will that we heaved
her through the sand into a foot and a half
deeper water. After we had moored her
we went all to prayers, and gave God
thanks that had given us our ship again.
</p>
<p>June 19.&mdash;There hath been the highest
tide that we have known since we have been
here, and in a happy hour have we got our
ship off. This evening I went up to our
watch-tree; and this was the first time I
could see any open water, anyway, except
that little by the shore-side. This sight
gave us some comfort.
</p>
<p>June 22.&mdash;We have sounded all about
the ship, where she was sunken, and find it
very bad ground, with stones three feet high,
and two of them within a ship&#8217;s breadth of
the ship, wherein did more manifestly appear
God&#8217;s mercies to us; for if when we forced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
her ashore she had stricken one blow against
these stones, it had broken her.
</p>
<p>June 24.&mdash;The wind hath put all the ice
upon us, so that for a while we were in such
apparent danger that I verily thought we
should have lost our ship. With poles and
oars did we heave away and part the ice
from her. But it was God that did protect
and preserve us; for it was past any man&#8217;s
understanding how the ship could endure it,
or we by our labor save her.
</p>
<p>June 26.&mdash;These have been indeed days
of fear and of confusion, but also, in the
end, of comfort. Yesterday evening I went
up to our watch-tree, taking a man with me,
who should make a fire on the highest place
of the island, to see if it would be answered.
When I was come to the tree I laid down
my lance, and while I climbed up to the top
of the tree, I ordered him to set fire to
some decayed wood thereabouts. He unadvisedly
set light to some trees that were to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
windward, so that they and all the rest too,
by reason it had been very hot weather, took
fire like flax or hemp; and the wind blowing
the fire towards me, I made haste down
the tree. But before I was half way down,
the fire reached its stem, and blazed so
fiercely upwards, that I had to leap off the
tree and down a steep hill, and in brief,
with much ado escaped burning. My companion
at last came to me, and was joyful to
see me, for he thought verily I had been
burned. And thus we went homewards
together, leaving the fire increasing, and still
burning most furiously. I slept but little all
night; and at break of day I made all our
powder and beef to be carried aboard. This
morning I went to the hills to look to the
fire, where I saw it did still burn most
furiously, both to the westward and northward.
Leaving a man upon the hills to
watch it, I came home immediately and made
the men take down our new set of sails
immediately and carry them to the seaside,
ready to be cast in, if occasion were, and
to make ready to take down our houses.
About noon the wind changed, and our sentinel
came running home, bringing us word
that the fire did follow him hard at his heels,
like a train of powder. It was no need to
bid us take down and carry all away to the
seaside. The fire came towards us with a
most terrible rattling noise, a full mile in
breadth, and by the time we had unroofed
our houses, and laid hands on our last
things, the fire was come to our town, and
seized on it, and burnt it down to the
ground. Our dogs howled, and then ran
into the sea. To-night shall we lie all
aboard the ship, and give God thanks that
he has shipped us in her again.

</div>

<p>June 29.&mdash;These three days have we
wrought hard in fetching our things aboard,
as likewise our water, and have been all
about the eastern point, searching for driftwood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Our pinnace, on which hath been
spent so much time and labor, we need not,
having our ship afloat again, wherefore I
have commended her to be sawn in pieces
and brought into the ship.
</p>
<p>June 30.&mdash;To-day have we most earnestly
continued our labor, and by eleven this
night was our ship in readiness, for we have
sought to finish our business with the week
and the month, that so we might the better
solemnize the Sabbath ashore to-morrow,
and so take leave of our wintering island.
</p>
<p>July 1.&mdash;To-day, the first of the month,
being Sunday, we were up betimes. We
went ashore, and first we marched up to the
high cross we had put up to mark the graves
of our dead companions. There we had
morning prayer, and walked up and down
till dinner-time. After dinner we walked
to the highest hills to see which way the
fire had wafted. We saw that it had consumed
to the westward sixteen miles at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
least, and the whole breadth of the island;
near about our cross and our dead it could
not come, because it was a bare sandy hill.
After evening prayer we went up to take the
last view of our dead, and then we presently
took boat and departed, and never put foot
more on that island; but in our ship we went
to prayer, beseeching God to continue His
mercies to us, and rendering Him thanks
for having thus restored us. Now go we on
our discovery, which achieved, I purpose
surely to return to England, unless it should
please God to take us first into His heavenly
kingdom. And so desiring the happiness of
all mankind in our general Saviour Jesus
Christ, I end this, my journal, written on
the island.&#8221;

<h2>THE DISCOVERERS OF MADEIRA.</h2>
</div>

<p>It was during the merry days of the reign
of King Edward III. of England, that a little
ship left the port of Bristol, sailing suddenly
and secretly, so that none knew to
what port she was bound.
</p>
<p>She was no trading vessel laden with
English goods for Calais, for her crew was
not composed of sailors; there were on
board only a few men, and these wore the
dress of English gentlemen. The strange
crew, the secret departure, all told the tale
of some danger from which they were seeking
to escape, and had we been on board we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
should have seen by the anxious faces of the
crew, by the quick, eager glances with which
they watched the shores as they sailed out
of the Bristol Channel, that they feared pursuit,
either for themselves or for some one
whom they had in charge. Though not
really sailors, they were doing their best to
guide the little vessel, and they had chosen
for captain a young Englishman called Lionel
Machin, whose directions they obeyed,
and in whom they appeared to have full
confidence.
</p>
<p>It was for Lionel&#8217;s sake that the party of
friends were now making their escape from
England. He had married a girl whom he
had long loved, but he had not gained the
consent of her father and mother. They
were powerful and rich, and he had reason
to fear that his young wife would be taken
from him through their influence with the
king, and therefore he had determined to
seek a French port, and to hide himself and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
wife in some French city which did not own
Edward as its king.
</p>
<p>But, ignorant as they were of navigation,
it was no easy matter for them to direct
their course aright, and, high winds springing
up, they were beaten about for five days
without catching sight of the coast of France.
They did not know in what direction they
were being carried, and all on board, especially
the new-made wife, were full of uneasiness
and dismay. Lionel encouraged
Arabella with loving and hopeful words,
even when his own heart was sinking low,
but his friends, who had come only for his
sake, and without well considering the dangers
and risks which they might encounter,
were fast losing spirit and hope. Their
merry adventure seemed to be turning into
sad earnest, and these light-hearted lads,
having nothing to sustain their courage when
pleasure was gone, now vented their disappointment
in continual murmurs and regrets.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Arabella herself tried to seem indifferent
to their danger, and secure in Lionel&#8217;s care;
she hid her tears, lest they might grieve
her husband; but when she thought that no
one saw her, she gave herself up to sorrow
and despair. She thought of her father and
mother whom she had left secretly, lest they
should forbid her marriage with Lionel, and
she longed with an aching heart for one
word of love and forgiveness. For hours
she would sit, her eyes turned toward that
part of the horizon where she had last seen
the coast of England, her thoughts busied
about her old home: her father, taking his
pleasures with a sad heart; her little sister,
weeping for her lost playmate; and, most of
all, her mother, upright and dry-eyed, after
the stern fashion of the day, but yet, as
Arabella well knew, ever thinking of her
absent and disobedient child, ever missing
the light step, the loving smile, the tender
touch of the daughter she had loved so well.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>But Lionel still kept up heart and hope,
still spoke gaily of the new home they would
soon make in sunny France&mdash;yes, even when
day after day passed by, and the watchers
saw no land, and knew that they must be
drifting far out of their course, away into
the wide unknown ocean. They had been
at sea more than a month when one morning
early, Lionel, who was pacing the deck,
heard behind him a sudden shout of joy.
</p>
<p>He did not turn, for there were tears in
his eyes which he must hide from his companions,
for he had now, for the first time,
learned from his wife of her repentance
and her grief, and he too was sad at heart
and well-nigh hopeless. But the shout was
repeated and taken up by other voices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Land, land at last!&#8221; they cried, and
Lionel turned to see, far in the distance,
the tall sharp outline either of a rock or of
the cliffs which guarded some unknown shore.
Wind and wave were steadily sweeping the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
vessel onward towards this haven of refuge,
and there was nothing to do but to watch the
sharpening outlines, and to see, as fog and
mist cleared before the sun, the sheer dark
rocks and deep valleys of their new home.
</p>
<p>Nearer still and nearer, till the land was
full in sight, and the famished and wearied
crew could see the green valleys and tree-covered
heights of this lovely island, could
almost hear the fall of the clear waters
which they saw glancing down the face of
the rocks.
</p>
<p>What land it was they knew not. No
houses were to be seen, no ships or canoes
flew out from under the shelter of the shore,
no natives gathered in fear or wonder on
the silent silver beach, only a number of
bright-winged birds came as if to greet the
new-comers, and settled fearless on the sails
and ropes.
</p>
<p>Quickly the ship&#8217;s one boat was lowered,
and some of Lionel&#8217;s companions, well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
armed, put off for the unknown shore.
Lionel would fain have been of the number,
but neither Arabella nor his friends would
permit him to run this risk. Ere long the
boat returned, and the adventurers climbed
on board as eager to speak as were their
companions to hear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A dainty and delicious country, truly,
Captain Lionel, but men we saw none,&#8221;
said the first speaker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The beasts thereon are tame, and have
no fear of man,&#8221; continued another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yea, and the land is a garden of flowers,
and the air soft, that it would give
back health to the dying; there will your
fair wife recover her bloom, and we all shall
rest after our grievous toil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fruits are there in plenty, they dropped
on us from the trees as we walked,&#8221; added
the first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here at last we have found a haven,&#8221;
answered Lionel; &#8220;here, my kinsmen and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
faithful friends, may you regain the strength
you have lost in my cause, yea, and win
your pardon in England by this fair news.
Arabella, you will soon be strong again,&#8221;
and Lionel, though he spoke confidently,
looked with evident anxiety toward the pale
face which bore the traces of sorrow as well
as of sickness.
</p>
<p>Soon the whole party, save some few who
remained in charge of the ship, were on
land, wandering with the glee of schoolboys
over the green plains and wooded hills on
which they seemed to be the first to set
foot. Choosing a sheltered spot among the
laurels and near to the bend of the river,
the new lords of the island soon built a
shelter for themselves, and brought thither
stores from the ship.
</p>
<p>In this happy retreat the fugitives spent
nearly a fortnight, seeming to forget, in the
peace and rest of the present, their past
wrong-doing and their past disasters.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>But on the thirteenth day a sudden and
violent storm broke over the island. The
ship was driven from her anchorage by the
force of the wind and waves, and was carried,
with those of the company then on
board, toward the north coast of Africa,
where she was at last completely wrecked.
The crew escaped with their lives, but only
to fall into the hands of the Moors, who,
regarding all Christian nations as their enemies,
immediately seized those poor English
gentlemen as slaves.
</p>
<p>Lionel and the few companions who were
left with him on the island, grieved deeply
for the loss of their companions, though
they knew not the terrible fate which had
befallen them. And mingled with their sorrow
was penitence too, for the wrong act
which had, as they felt, brought on them
this deserved punishment. But Arabella&#8217;s
grief was deeper; from the time when this
new disaster befell them she never spoke,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
but sat gazing ever over the now calm
sea which parted her from her home; and
thus she pined and died, deeply oppressed
with grief, and not comforted with the assurance
of the pardon which Christ the
Saviour gives to all who repent and turn
from sin.
</p>
<p>Lionel could not endure without her the
life which he had sought for her sake, and
ere long he, too, died in the arms of his
weeping friends, and husband and wife were
buried at the foot of the laurels which had
been their shelter.
</p>
<p>The remaining adventurers determined at
any risk to leave the island in the little
boat which still remained to them, for the
place now became distasteful; but before
they sailed they set up over the grave of
the husband and wife a wooden cross, on
which were carved their names. Then, following
the wish of Lionel, they added below
a request that if any Christians should hereafter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
come to dwell in this island, they would
build over the grave a church, in which
our Saviour Jesus might be worshipped
and adored.
</p>
<p>The little boat being now ready and
stored with birds and other food as provisions
for their voyage, they set sail, but
were, like their companions, cast on the
coast of Africa, and made slaves with those
who had gone before them. But the poor
Englishmen were not the only captives, for
in those times shipwrecked sailors from all
parts of Europe were held in cruel slavery
by the Moors.
</p>
<p>Side by side with the companions of
Lionel worked a young Spanish sailor
named Jean de Morales, and, glad of any
relief from the toil and tedium of their sad
life, he listened eagerly to the often-repeated
story of the lovely and beautiful island.
Of this unknown land he dreamed and
thought continually, longing for freedom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
that he might discover and tread its silent
shores, for he was of a nation eager for
discovery, and the highest rewards and
honors were not thought too great for him
who should add a new country to the dominions
of the crown of Castile.
</p>
<p>At length it happened that a sum of
money was sent to Barbary, to ransom some
of the Spanish captives, and Jean de Morales
was amongst those set at liberty: but
the ship in which, with glad heart and high
hopes, he sailed for Spain, was captured on
its way by a Portuguese man-of-war, under
Jean Gonsalie Lascoe. All the captives
from Barbary, who had already suffered so
much, were permitted to continue their
journey home, save only Jean de Morales.
</p>
<p>This one exception was made because the
Portuguese captain was not willing to give
to Spain the glory of the discovery which
the Castilian sailor was longing to attempt.
Jean de Morales was, however, kindly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
treated, and at last took service with the
Portuguese, his attachment to his native land
being doubtless weakened by his long captivity.
</p>
<p>Very soon, ships were sent out by Portugal
commanded by Gonsalie, with Jean de
Morales on board, to seek this new and
unclaimed island. The vessels first held
their course for the Island of Porto Sanco,
near which the new island was supposed to
lie, for seen from Porto Sanco toward the
north-east was a heavy cloud, sometimes
brighter, sometimes darker, but never wholly
dispersed.
</p>
<p>The ignorant and superstitious inhabitants
had many wonderful stories to relate of this
cloud; they all believed that no ship could
safely approach it. Some held it to be an
island hanging between heaven and earth,
in which some Christians had been hidden
by God from the power of their Moorish
foes, some that it led into the land of spirits.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Towards this cloud Gonsalie steered
his ships, in spite of the murmurs and
almost the open mutiny of his terrified
crew. &#8220;The shadow is but a mist,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;a cloud caused by the heat of the sun&#8217;s
rays drawing the moisture from the land
beneath; have no fear, my children, for
those who do their duty will God protect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Through the mists and heavy clouds they
sailed on, and at last emerged into clear,
pure air, to see fair before them the island
of their hopes. The sailors who had before
resisted the captain&#8217;s will, now fell on their
knees begging his forgiveness, and praying
to be allowed to land at once and wander
through the valleys of this lovely land.
Soon Gonsalie, Jean de Morales, and some
of the sailors pulled through the surf and
set foot on the island, which they called
Madeira, because it was so well wooded.
They landed almost on the very spot where
Lionel and Arabella had first come on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
shore, and before long the new-comers stood
in reverence and in pity by the graves of
the first discoverers.
</p>
<p>The island was formally taken possession
of in the name of the King of Portugal, and
before long a colony was sent thither, Gonsalie
being appointed governor.
</p>
<p>Then the dying wish of Lionel was
granted, and over his grave was built a
church, in which the new inhabitants might
worship God.
</p>
<p>This is the story which we have received
as the history of the discovery of the island
of Madeira, now so well and so familiarly
known to us, where many of our own countrymen
go year by year, seeking to recover
health and strength amongst the sheltered
and wooded vales where the English husband
and wife found their last refuge.

</p>
</div>

<p>The history was written in Portuguese
by Don Francesco Alcafarado, a noble at the
court of King John I. of Portugal. He
was himself one of the discoverers. It is
considered possible that some of the details
which he has given may have been altered
in his memory, or confused by those from
whom he heard the story of Lionel and
Arabella, but there seems no reason to
doubt the chief facts which he relates. The
cross erected over the graves of the husband
and wife was preserved in Madeira till
at least the early part of this century, and
possibly is still to be seen.

<h2>ST. HELENA.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the days when voyages were more
tedious and dangerous than they are now,
when steam was unknown, and the art of
navigation little studied, it was especially
important to secure safe resting-places for
vessels bound on distant voyages. Halfway
ports where the health of the sailors
might be recruited, where the ship often
battered and leaking, might be repaired,
and stored once more with water and fresh
vegetables, were absolutely essential to safe
and profitable commerce.
</p>
<p>But until about the year 1500 the Venetian
traders to India had found no such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
harbor of refuge in the South Atlantic.
Their ships came and went nevertheless, and
if many were lost, yet the profits of the
trade were such as to repay the merchants
for many a bale of rich goods which lay
beneath the waters, and to lead Venice to
guard as one of her most valuable rights the
trade with India.
</p>
<p>The Portuguese also were merchants and
explorers, and had a large and important
navy, and they were not content to leave
the Indian traffic wholly in the hands of the
Venetians. Therefore about the year 1501
three vessels were sent out to India by the
Portuguese Government. On their return
voyage during May of the following year a
sudden and violent storm overtook them.
</p>
<p>They were in the midst of the wide Atlantic,
driven backwards and forwards by
the furious wind and waves.
</p>
<p>One of the ships was separated from the
other two, and was in greater danger. All
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
hope of guiding her was at an end, and the
captain and crew stood waiting in despair
for the death which could not be far distant.
</p>
<p>It seems probable from that which afterwards
happened, that some at least among
the sailors thought, in their danger, on
God, and cried to Him to save them. And
we may well believe this to have been so.
There are but few who when trouble is near
forget God. It is in smooth and fair water,
in calm and sunshine, that we are so ready
to think that we can guide and help ourselves.
When the clouds gather, and the
storm-winds blow, then we cry unto God in
our trouble. And God is so good that He
does not turn away from those who call on
Him in their need, even when in their joy
they had turned away from Him.
</p>
<p>Help came to these sailors tossed on the
wide, wild sea, but it did not come in the
way that they had hoped. At first it seemed
only like greater peril, for through the haze
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
which darkened the sea, the dim outline of
land was seen, standing high, sharp, and
dark against the sky.
</p>
<p>What land it could be they did not know.
In such rough charts as they possessed, no
rock even was marked, no speck of land
for many hundred miles on either side the
place where they were now fighting for their
lives.
</p>
<p>The ship was driven nearer and nearer,
and, so far as the mariners could tell, they
were being driven to certain destruction,
for what ship could hope to avoid the terrible
wall of rocks before them, or live in
the white seething waters which boiled at
its foot. A shout, an eager wondering cry,
from one of the sailors, roused his comrades;
he was pointing to a narrow inlet
between the rocks, on either side of which
the sand lay smooth and low&mdash;if they could
only gain that opening there might yet be
hope. But the ship was past all guidance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
and the only chance of life seemed to lie in
the boats, which might be directed up the
narrow inlet, so that the men might land in
safety on its shores. At last the anxious,
terrified sailors stood safely on the beach,
watching the still raging sea as it washed to
their feet plank and mast and rudder of
their now broken ship.
</p>
<p>Their first thought was to offer thanks to
God who had delivered them, and then they
began to look around at this strange unknown
land on which they had been thrown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us build ourselves a shelter with the
planks of the broken ship, she will never
sail blue water again,&#8221; said one sailor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; replied another, &#8220;rather let us
build a house for God, let us leave a church
on this island. We need no shelter in the
warm May weather, no rain will fall for
months yet, I warrant, and some of those
rare trees yonder will be our fittest roof.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But of what use can a church be when
none dwell here to worship?&#8221; asked a third.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtless many will come to dwell here
when we return home and tell the story of
the new land, and many ships will stay
here to rest the sailors and to gather stores.
Were it not well done that they should
find prepared a place which should remind
them of their duty to their God, and of His
care of them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said the captain, speaking now
for the first time, &#8220;were it not well done
that we, whom He has so wonderfully preserved,
should try even in this imperfect
fashion to show our gratitude? He will accept
even such poor service, therefore, in
my judgment, let it be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it be done,&#8221; cried all, and, as if
impatient to begin, the sailors rushed knee-deep
into the sea, seizing and drawing high
on the beach the floating spars and planks
ready for their new service.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>But before such work could be begun it
was needful to explore the new land, to
search for any traces of inhabitants, and
above all to discover, if possible, food and
water to refresh themselves.
</p>
<p>There was one high peak, towering above
the many hills which crowned the island,
and towards this a party of sailors made
their way, keeping closely together for fear
that the natives of the land might suddenly
attack them from rock or thicket.
</p>
<p>The steep, rugged, broken hill was scaled
at last, and from its summit the adventurers
looked down on their place of refuge.
They were on an island, which seemed to be
some miles in length; it was thickly covered
with trees, and in one part a broad, open
plain, fresh and fertile, stretched before
them. There were many streams, dancing
merrily down the broken cliffs, or shaded
by tall tree-ferns and waving grasses. But
nowhere was there any sign of human habitation;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
no palm-roofed huts, no canoes, no
figures crossing the open spaces between the
trees. And not only man, but even animals
seemed wanting here.
</p>
<p>The place was a complete solitude; the
sea-birds had not strayed farther than the
cliffs where their nests were made, and save
one little brown bird, not unlike a sparrow,
which chirped among the boughs, the sailors
neither heard nor saw any signs of life.
</p>
<p>Fruit there was in abundance on the trees,
and with this spoil they hastened back to
their comrades, who had meanwhile been
exploring the sides of the inlet.
</p>
<p>A shout from the party of these explorers
told the descending sailors that some discovery
had been made, and as they came
nearer they saw that a fire had been kindled
on the beach, though with what object it
was hard to guess.
</p>
<p>They were not long left in doubt, for
shouts of &#8220;Turtle, turtle! come and see the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
turtle we have cooked for dinner!&#8221; caused
them to hasten to the fire, on which was
now seething an immense turtle, great numbers
of which were to be seen crawling
along the beach.
</p>
<p>The fruit was a welcome addition to the
feast, and the sailors were soon forgetting
peril and disaster over a hearty and refreshing
repast.
</p>
<p>Then the whole party stretched themselves
at ease under the trees; they recounted to
each other their adventures and discoveries.
It was clear that they were on an island,
and that this island was far distant from
any known land. There appeared no doubt
that it was uninhabited and unknown, and
great was the satisfaction of the captain in the
thought of carrying home to Portugal the
tidings of a discovery so important. For
all saw what great service would be done to
Portuguese commerce by the establishment
of a half-way station on their return from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
India, and the feeling of regret for their
lost ship was swallowed up and forgotten
in delight at the honor which they should
receive at having first planted the flag of
Portugal on the Island of St. Helena, for
thus did the captain name the newly-found
island.
</p>
<p>The sailors made no doubt that now the
violence of the storm was over, that they
would soon be rescued from their imprisonment
by the other ships, and meanwhile
they set heartily to work to build their
church.
</p>
<p>The ship&#8217;s carpenter undertook the principal
directions, while the captain determined
on the best site for the new building,
and marked its outline on the turf.
</p>
<p>Willing hands made the work light, and
ere many days had passed the church began
to rise, plank by plank, amid the palm-trees
and leafy shade around.
</p>
<p>The two remaining ships soon arrived,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
and their crews stayed long enough to complete
the church, and to lay in a store of
fruit, turtles, and fresh water, and then all
set sail for Portugal, and St. Helena for
long years was henceforth reckoned among
the possessions of that crown.
</p>
<p>But though highly prized as a resting-place
for ships, it did not at first become
a colony. Two small dwellings were built
on either side the church, but none inhabited
them for about twelve years, when a
Portuguese nobleman, named Lopez, came
to live there in banishment, with no companions
but three or four negro slaves, who
under his direction, cultivated the soil,
planted and reared many new kinds of trees
and fruits, and tended the fowls and animals
which were abundantly supplied for his
needs.
</p>
<p>He did not, however, continue many years
in St. Helena, and long the island remained
without inhabitants.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>Sometimes a passing ship would leave one
or more of her crew, who were ill, that they
might be restored by the vegetables and
fruits, the pure air and clear water of the
island.
</p>
<p>It happened once, nearly ninety years
after the first discovery, that an English
crew landed for refreshment, and wandering
about the island approached the little church.
They believed themselves the only human
beings on the island, and were therefore
greatly surprised to hear a voice singing
within the church.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a Portuguese,&#8221; they said one to
another, &#8220;let us enter and make him prisoner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without another word the doors were
thrown open, and there kneeling alone in
the church, they discovered a strange figure,
wild and terrified, dressed in a rough suit
of goat-skin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; cried the foremost of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the sailors, forgetting that the supposed
Portuguese was not likely to answer an
English question; but the man started to
his feet at the words, gazed round him,
looking one by one into the eager and wondering
faces before him, and then, as if he
could no longer contain his joy, he rushed
towards them, and threw himself into the
arms of the foremost.
</p>
<p>He, in his turn, had feared that the new-comers
were Portuguese, and the poor English
sailor, for such he was, had endured an
agony of terror till the sound of English
speech assured him that he was among
friends and fellow-countrymen.
</p>
<p>His story was soon told. He had been
left at St. Helena by a passing ship, because
he was so reduced by the voyage that the
captain feared that he could never reach his
home. Here he had lived for fourteen long
months, and had never during that time
heard a human voice, or seen the face of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
friend. He had lived chiefly on the flesh
of goats, which had now multiplied on the
island, and had in his wild, free life quite
recovered his health. But the joy of meeting
with friends after so long a solitude
was too great; he was quite unable to sleep,
and only lived till the ship in which he had
taken passage reached the West Indies.
</p>
<p>St. Helena passed at length into the hands
of the English, was colonized and brought
into cultivation, and it was here that Napoleon
ended the career which had laid waste
and despoiled Europe. Here in this little
island was bounded his wide ambition; the
sea set limits to his steps on every side and
stretched its strong impassible barrier all
around him. Here, though not alone, he
endured a solitude which was doubtless
heavier to bear and more hopeless than that
felt by any of the wanderers who in early
days were left upon that shore. For there
is no solitude like that of a heart which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
dwells alone, whose memories of the past
can bring no gladness, and whose future
lies cheerless and blank before it.
</p>
<p>He spent his time chiefly in reading,
riding on horseback, and digging in his
garden. He was fond of amusing himself
with children, and would join in all their
little sports. He employed himself, also,
in writing the memoirs of his own campaigns.
&#8220;Let us live on the past,&#8221; he
said. But ah! what satisfaction could a view
of his past life have afforded him? Those
who have lived only for this world must
never expect anything but self-reproach in
reviewing the opportunities of usefulness
which they have lost, and the precious talents
they have misemployed. What a favorable
opportunity, however, was afforded
to Napoleon in his solitude at St. Helena, of
examining his past life. Happy would it
have been for him if he had diligently
used the time thus given him in mourning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
for his sins, and humbling himself for the
misapplication of the vast talents entrusted
to his charge.

</p>
</div>

<p>That he sometimes thought of the subject
of religion, indeed, is evident, if we believe
a conversation which Count Monthoton, one
of his attendants, has recorded. &#8220;Alexander,
Caesar, Charlemagne, and myself,&#8221;
Napoleon is represented to have said, &#8220;founded
empires upon force! Jesus Christ alone
founded His empire upon love; and at this
hour millions of men would die for Him. I
die before my time, and my body will be
given back to the earth to become food for
worms. Such is the fate which so soon
awaits him who has been called the Great
Napoleon! what a difference between my
deep misery and the eternal kingdom of
Christ, which is proclaimed, loved, and
adored, and which is extending over the
whole earth. Call you this dying? Is it not
living rather? The death of Christ is the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
death of a God!&#8221; Napoleon became every
day more and more unhappy. He used to
feed some fish in a pond, but they sickened
and died. &#8220;Everything that I love,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;leaves me: everything that belongs to
me is stricken!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At last the event came which released him
from all his earthly sorrows. A painful disease,
called cancer in the stomach, attacked
him; and, after considerable suffering, he expired
on the 5th of May, 1821. The night of
his dissolution was a terrible one; a fearful
storm was raging all around. Napoleon
had, for some hours, been insensible;
towards six o&#8217;clock in the evening, however,
he pronounced the words, &#8220;Head of
the Army,&#8221; as if his thoughts were running
on the field of battle, and immediately
afterwards his immortal spirit quitted the
tabernacle of clay in which it dwelt. Such
was Napoleon&#8217;s death-bed. Alas! we look
in vain upon it for that language of triumph
which has so often broken from the lips of
the followers of Jesus, when passing through
the dark &#8220;valley of the shadow of death.&#8221;
With Napoleon&#8217;s dying moments, contrast
those of an eminent saint of God, Dr. Payson.
&#8220;I seem to swim in a flood of glory,&#8221;
said he to some young persons, &#8220;which God
pours down upon me. And I know&mdash;I know
that my happiness is but begun&mdash;I cannot
doubt that it will last for ever. My young
friends, were I master of the whole world,
what could it do for me like this! Nothing,
nothing. Now all this happiness I trace
back to the religion which I have preached,
and to the time when that great change
took place in my heart, which, I have often
told you, is necessary to salvation;&mdash;and
I now tell you again, that without this
change you cannot, no, you cannot see the
kingdom of God!&#8221;

<p>Napoleon was buried at Longwood, in the
Island of St. Helena, under a large willow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
tree; but in 1840 his remains, with the
consent of the British Government, were
removed to Paris, and buried with grand
honors in that city.

<h2>THE PITCAIRN ISLANDERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Many islands have at different times risen
above the sea, which had for long years
washed over and hidden them. There are
two ways in which new islands are thus
born like a fresh creation from God.
</p>
<p>The great volcanic force which sends out
flames and ashes from the tops of high
mountains, or makes the solid earth tremble
and crack, is at work also below the bed of
the sea, and from time to time islands are
raised there either slowly or by some sudden
convulsion, just as we have also reason to
believe that other islands are even now sinking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
lower under the influence of the same
force, until, most likely, in years to come,
the waves will once more flow over them
again. You must not forget that when we
talk of the forces of nature we mean really
the hand of God. He it is who sends these
great convulsions, or who directs the slow
upheaving of new land. All is quite as
truly the work of God as when, at His word,
the dry land first appeared. &#8220;Fire and
hail, snow and vapors, stormy wind,&#8221; are
all &#8220;fulfilling His word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Many of these islands, when first raised
above the sea, must have been active volcanoes,
sending out hot from their craters the
flood of lava and the heated rocks which
now lie cold and hard, and overgrown with
moss, to tell us of their past history.
</p>
<p>Of course, while this was going on there
could be no life either of plants or animals
on the mountain, which, indeed, as yet could
scarcely be called an island, only a bare
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
rock, around which the waves would beat,
as if in hopeless endeavor to extinguish the
fire which glowed deep in its caverned
centre. But though neither waves nor
storms could make this fire die out, yet
there comes a time to most of these volcanic
islands when the life and energy of the
mountain seems gone, taken away, we know
not how, by the same Great Hand that
lighted it, and the lonely rock is now ready
to be turned into a home for man, for this
silent crater, this hard, broken crag, will,
after a time, become a fair island home.
God does not leave His works incomplete,
and He has servants who will change this
desolate rock into a fertile garden.
</p>
<p>He sends the waves; they dash on the
sides of the island, which rise generally
abrupt and strong from the deep waters,
and wherever they can find entrance they
wear and powder the rock until it becomes
fine soil, and a little beach is formed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
Then rains fall and fill the clefts and hollows
of the rock, and soften it at length as
they wash down its face, till here and there
patches of scanty soil are formed.
</p>
<p>But something more than soil is needed;
the most fertile land cannot of itself produce
grass or herbs; there must be a seed
before even the smallest weed can spring up,
and those which float about in the air with
us, are not found on a volcanic rock far
away in the sea.
</p>
<p>But messengers are prepared to bring
them. Birds flying over the water sometimes
stoop their wings to rest awhile on
the rock, and often leave behind them seeds
which they have gathered in far distant
lands. At first, perhaps, only a few small
weeds are seen. These, dying in their turn,
improve the soil for their successors, until
at length it can support shrubs and undergrowth,
the seeds of which are sometimes
washed on the shore by the waves, or found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
hidden in the clefts of some tree which has
floated to the island from a distant shore.
</p>
<p>Last of all arises, like a crown of beauty,
the graceful cocoa-nut palm, spreading broad
leaves around its tall, slender stem, and
making the once barren rock a shady and
lovely retreat.
</p>
<p>The island on which Alexander Selkirk
lived is considered volcanic; it is probably
formed in some such manner as that which
we have described. Madeira, too, and probably
St. Helena, are volcanic islands.
</p>
<p>Pitcairn, the history of which you are
now going to read, is also possibly of volcanic
origin, and its high crags and sharp
peaks seem as if they must have been
thrown up by some sudden force; but as it
is in the midst of a sea covered with coral
islands, and has been supposed by some to
be itself partially formed by coral insects,
it may be well that you should hear a little
of the wonderful growth of coral islands,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
which, though formed so differently from
those of which you have been reading, are
yet, when once their tops have risen above
the waves, clothed in the same manner with
fair growth, to prepare them for the presence
of man. Tahiti, which you will hear
mentioned in the story of Pitcairn, is a coral
island, and they abound in groups, in pairs,
or in single islands, through the wide Pacific
Ocean.
</p>
<p>They are formed by myriads of tiny insects,
which are connected together, and
seem to share a common life. One of these
insects fastens itself on some hidden rock;
sometimes it may be on an extinct volcano
which is not lofty enough to appear above
the waves, and on this foundation they begin
to build, the insect, as it shapes its cells of
coral, filling them with beings like itself,
so that every tiny chamber has its inmate.
Soon the whole rock is covered below the
water with a fine network of delicate coral,
and from the tops of the open cells the
insects put out their delicate <i>tentaculae</i>, or
arms, which look like the petals of a flower.
By means of the food gathered from the
water by these <i>tentaculae</i>, all the coral insects
are fed.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/island-092.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
Coral Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 92.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>Thus each one does its appointed work,
laying unseen the foundations of a new
land, for the coral growth is still spreading
and rising higher and higher, till at length
the waves begin to feel its resistance, and
to break in white foam around its crests.
</p>
<p>Its history, when it has once risen above
the reach of the tides, is like that of the
volcanic islands. The insects die, and the
bare grey rock is left, that God&#8217;s servants,
the waves and winds, may fulfil His will,
until in His own good time the coral island
becomes lovely and fertile, fit for the dwelling-place
of those who should be God&#8217;s best
servants&mdash;the men whom He has made for
His glory, and for whose redemption His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Son came down to die. It is sad to think
how often man, to whom God has given the
most, is the least ready to use these gifts
for his Maker&#8217;s glory, so that instead of
these lovely islands being always full of
His praise, they are often homes of sin and
of unhappiness, as indeed it was at first
with Pitcairn, the history of which we now
give.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Far away from any other land, in the
midst of the South Pacific Ocean, there is
a little island, a mere speck in the sea, for
it is not six miles across at its widest point.
A passing ship might leave this tiny island
unnoticed, save for the lofty cliffs and precipices
which guard its shores, running down
to the white waves, ever curling and breaking
at their feet. Yet it was not a mere
rock, inaccessible and barren; for when once
a boat has safely won its way through the
breakers, and the sailor has climbed the rocks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
which, steep above steep, stand like a wall
before him, he is rewarded by the sight of
lovely valleys, of forests of fruit-bearing
palms, and of green, fresh-springing plants:
a little fairy land, a new paradise seems
hidden here from the eye and the foot of
man.
</p>
<p>It is called Pitcairn&#8217;s Island, and was
discovered more than a hundred years ago
by a passing ship. It was uninhabited, and
no one set foot on it again, till in 1789 a
small ship might have been seen approaching
its shores, as if she would seek an anchorage
in that dangerous, rocky bay.
</p>
<p>The ship is called the <i>Bounty</i>, and carries
for her crew nine English seamen, and
some colored men and women, natives of
Tahiti, an island at which the <i>Bounty</i> had
been recently anchored.
</p>
<p>There is no captain on board, though the
first mate, Fletcher Christian, seems to take
his place and to direct the course of the ship;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
but his words are few, and his face is sad,
as if some past trouble or sin weighed on
his heart, and, when he is not obliged to
be active, he sits gazing listlessly over the
water, looking for he knows not what.
</p>
<p>It would be a long and sad story to tell
how that ship came to be thus cruising in
the wide Pacific. Months before, Fletcher
Christian and some of the sailors of the
<i>Bounty</i> had mutinied; had put their captain,
who by his harsh and unjust treatment
had provoked their anger, into the ship&#8217;s
launch with eighteen of the crew, leaving
them thus to reach home or to die on the
ocean.
</p>
<p>The mutineers well knew that if they
returned to England, their own lives would
pay the penalty of their crime, and therefore
they determined to spend the rest of
their days on some one of the numerous islands
scattered in groups throughout the
South Seas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>But as they had begun their course by an
act which they knew to be wrong, it was
not likely that their future would be happy
and prosperous; the sweet flowers of peace
and content do not spring from the bitter
root of sin, &#8220;neither do men gather grapes
of thorns nor figs of thistles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus we need not wonder that trouble and
dissension seemed to follow everywhere the
ill-fated crew of the <i>Bounty</i>. They quarrelled
and fought with the natives of the
first island which they chose for an asylum;
they disputed among themselves, suspecting
and hating each other, as partners in sin
most often do. The hearts of the leaders
were full of fear also as they thought of the
laws which they had broken, and of the fate
which would be theirs should their captain
reach England, and a ship be sent out to
capture them.
</p>
<p>At last the mutineers sailed for the Island
of Tahiti, where they knew that the inhabitants
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
were well-disposed and gentle, and
would be pleased to welcome the white man
to live among them. Fletcher Christian,
however, could not rest; he had been the
leader in the mutiny, he knew that he would
be sought for, and that if found he must die,
and die covered with disgrace.
</p>
<p>Therefore he determined to seek out Pitcairn&#8217;s
Island, of the discovery of which he
had heard, and there pass the remainder of
his miserable life. Eight of his comrades
decided to go with him, the rest remaining
at Tahiti, and, as we have seen, some of
the Tahitian men and women agreed to
make the voyage with them, and join in the
new settlement.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/island-099.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
Landing of the Mutineers on Pitcairn&#8217;s Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 99.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>After long seeking, after cruising backwards
and forwards for many days in the
sailless and shoreless ocean, the island that
they sought was seen standing high above a
line of white waves, and after much difficulty
the <i>Bounty</i> was anchored, and her boat sent
on shore with some of her crew.
</p>
<p>Everything of value on board was taken
to the island, even the iron-work of the ship
itself being removed, and when the <i>Bounty</i>
was reduced to an empty and useless hulk,
she was set on fire and burnt to the water-edge,
that no passing ship might see any
trace of inhabitants on the lonely island
where these unhappy men sought to hide
themselves.
</p>
<p>Fletcher Christian, who had taken the
command hitherto by the consent of his
companions, now proceeded to divide the
whole island into nine equal parts, one of
which he gave to each of the English sailors
who accompanied him, choosing for his own
portion a piece of land at the farther end of
the island, where he made for himself a
retreat among the steep rocks which overlooked
the sea.
</p>
<p>But though the new colony was so small,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
it had in it all the seeds of dissension and
of unhappiness. Even these nine men,
though bound together by a common fate
and by a common fear, could not agree,
could not bear with nor yield to each other
in any of the little differences or misunderstandings
which arose between them from
time to time. Still less could they live in
peace with the natives who had accompanied
them. They looked on these poor men and
women as their slaves, and treated them so
unjustly that the Tahitians, who had at first
been attached and faithful, now determined
on revenge. They were as much less guilty
than the English as they were more ignorant;
they had never been taught to be merciful,
to forgive injuries, to be patient under
wrongs; the blessed name of Jesus was not
familiar to their ears, nor the lessons of His
life and death to their hearts. They knew
no law but that of violence and might, and
finding themselves unjustly treated by those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
who had promised to be their friends, they
formed a plot to put them all to death, and
so to make themselves masters of the island.
</p>
<p>Five out of the nine Englishmen were
shot, and amongst them was their leader,
Fletcher Christian. Ever since he had come
to Pitcairn&#8217;s Island, he had appeared sunk
in sorrow and remorse. All day long he
had remained hidden among the rocks, away
from his comrades, his eyes fastened on the
wide ocean, the barrier which he knew must
now divide him for ever from his home and
from all he loved. In this solitude his
companion was the Bible, brought on shore
by him from the ship. In this he was observed
to be often reading, and though we
know nothing of his thoughts nor of his
prayers, it may be that God spake through
His word to the heart of His erring child,
and bade him, not in vain, to seek His face
once more.
</p>
<p>Let us hope that this Bible charged with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
such a blessed mission in years to come,
was sent also with a message to this desolate
heart, and that ere he died, Christian had
sought and found the forgiveness which is
given through the cross of Christ our Saviour.
Some sign of his repentance may be
found in a tradition handed down by the
islanders, that he had given orders that
everyone on the island should repeat each
noontide the prayer of the returning and
repentant prodigal: &#8220;Father, I have sinned
against heaven and before thee, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Four white men had been saved by the
interference of the Tahitian women from the
fate of their comrades, but they did not feel
safe; they believed that the men were still
seeking their lives, and, as they imagined,
in self-defence, they determined to put these
their enemies to death. Thus the evil
begun by the mutiny still went on from
crime to crime, seeming to grow ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
deeper and wider. For the dark and terrible
story is not yet ended. Two of the four
remaining Englishmen soon after came to a
violent end, while intoxicated by a drink
which they had contrived to make from
some of the plants which they found on the
island, thus bringing into this lovely refuge
the vice and drunkenness which beset
crowded cities.
</p>
<p>The sorrowful tale has hitherto been all
dark, ever growing more gloomy and hopeless;
but now for the first time a faint pencil
of light, like the first streak of dawn,
marks the sky, a ray which, like all true
sunshine, comes from heaven and from God.
The great and loving Father had not forgotten
the children who had so long forgotten
Him; this little island, so far from the
eyes of human watchers was not unseen nor
unregarded by Him. His messengers, the
books which tell of Him, were still there,
though forgotten and unread; but the time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
was now come when they were to speak
again, and were to be heard and obeyed.
</p>
<p>The two remaining mutineers were a
sailor named Alexander Smith, or, as he
now called himself, John Adams, and a
midshipman named Edward Young. The
midshipman had been well educated, and
had learnt above all, in his childhood, the
blessed lessons of God&#8217;s love, and of the
grace of Christ. These lessons, too long
unremembered, now came back to him. Perhaps
he thought of the days when, a young
child, he had knelt at his mother&#8217;s knee, or
standing by her chair, had read one by one,
as her finger slowly pointed them out, the
words of the Holy Bible.
</p>
<p>The good seed had lain long in a barren
soil, now God in His mercy sent the rain
and sunshine of His grace to cause it to
spring up at last. No sooner had Edward
Young begun to desire to return to the Saviour
whom he had left, than he also wished
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
that those around him should be taught of
His love. The helpless women and children
were, he felt, a sacred charge for him
and his companion, to teach and guide.
</p>
<p>Accordingly morning and evening prayers
were established in the island, and a sort of
school was begun for the children, John
Adams being partly a teacher, partly a
scholar, and so preparing to take his comrade&#8217;s
work when, a little time after this
change of heart and life, Edward Young
died, and left his comrade alone on the island
with his untaught charge. He, the
only one who had the key to God&#8217;s book,
the only one in whose memory were stored
any lessons of His truth, in whose life lay,
as it seemed, the only hope that this little
colony might be saved from all the cruelty
and ignorance of savage life, and added to
the number of the servants of Christ.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Nearly twenty-five years had passed since
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
John Adams was left on Pitcairn&#8217;s Island,
the sole protector and teacher of the women,
and of the young children who were growing
up around him. He was himself but a
common sailor, who had enjoyed only a few
advantages of education, his only acquirements
the simple lessons which had been
taught him in his boyhood, and a new but
straightforward and earnest desire to serve
God in the way which God should teach
him, and in penitence and faith to walk
himself and to lead others to walk in the
way that leads to everlasting life.
</p>
<p>But God does not choose only the wise
and the great and the strong for His workmen:
often the weak things of the world
are chosen to confound the mighty, and the
poor and lowly to do the work of the High
and Mighty One who inhabiteth eternity.
</p>
<p>We have seen how evil passions indulged
were like a seed of sin, growing and spreading
into a mighty and poisonous tree. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
there was planted by its side, through the
mercy of God, a germ of good and of life&mdash;has
that too lived and spread, or has it
withered and died beneath the shade of
evil?
</p>
<p>Two English vessels are approaching the
island. At first the crews do not see it,
but as evening draws on, the look-out man
in the larger ship gives the signal that he
has caught sight of land. &#8220;Land ho, land!&#8221;
passes from mouth to mouth among the
sailors. What land can it be? No island,
no rock even, is marked on the chart, and
the officers gather on deck to look over the
darkening sea toward that darker point
where the new land lies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may have discovered a new island
for King George,&#8221; says the captain. &#8220;We
must lie to till the morning, and then we will
sail nearer, and see this unknown shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The morning comes, and almost before it
is day some of the officers are on deck with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
their glasses, eagerly looking toward the
island, which they can now see far more
plainly. Even without a glass its lofty
rocks and steep precipices can be distinguished.
The ships are approaching nearer
and nearer, till now their anchors are
dropped, and one of the captains orders a
boat to be prepared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Though I doubt how we shall get her
through the surf,&#8221; he says, ponderingly;
&#8220;it is a dangerous coast, and no pilot within
hail. People there too, I see&mdash;savages.
The men must go well armed. Peters, look
to the loading of the pistols.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, sir,&#8221; answered Peters, looking,
like the rest, towards the rocks, where
groups of people coming and going were
to be seen.
</p>
<p>There was evidently great excitement on
the island. A ship was a strange and unusual
sight, no doubt.
</p>
<p>Before the ship&#8217;s boat could be launched,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
two men were seen to climb the top of the
steep cliff which almost overhung the narrow
beach. They, however, seemed to find
no difficulty in their dangerous path, though
each carried on his shoulders a light canoe.
The strangers wore some kind of clothing,
but even through the captain&#8217;s glass it was
impossible to tell of what race they were.
</p>
<p>Dark against the clear sky, the two figures
were seen for awhile to stand gazing
steadfastly toward the ship, and then
bounded like goats down the rugged face of
the rock, and soon launched their canoes
fearlessly in the angry surf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haul the boat up, we&#8217;ll wait and receive
these natives on board,&#8221; says the captain;
and in a few minutes one of the canoes was
under the bows of the ship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come alongside,&#8221; shouted a sailor, trusting
that his signs and gestures would explain
the meaning of his English words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no boat-hook to hold on by,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
cried in answer the foremost of their visitors.
</p>
<p>No words can explain the surprise with
which the captain and the whole crew listened
to these words spoken in pure English
by the supposed savage. They looked at
him and at each other, but no one spoke
till the eager voice was again heard from
the boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you heave us a rope now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sailor seized and flung one end of a
coil of rope, and in a moment their strange
visitor had seized it and climbed fearlessly
on deck.
</p>
<p>He was a tall man, young, and almost
English-looking, save that his complexion
was tinged by the hot sun of his country;
and his whole face and bearing were those
of an educated and civilized man. His dress
was a light vest and short trousers, while
his palm-leaf hat was adorned with a bunch
of brilliant feathers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the astonished
captain, gazing at this strange and unexpected
apparition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Thursday October Christian, the
son of the mutineer, and there,&#8221; pointing
to the other canoe, now close to the ship,
&#8220;is Edward Young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mystery was now explained: the
ships had anchored at the island where the
mutineers, long sought in vain, had taken
refuge.
</p>
<p>The officers crowded round their visitors,
asking question after question, of their age,
the number of people on the island, their
habits and mode of life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is your king?&#8221; they asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, King George, to be sure,&#8221; replied
Christian, quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been taught any religion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;a very good religion;
that which the Bible teaches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young men were led into every part
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
of the ship; they looked with great interest
at the many things they saw around them,
the uses and even the names of which were
unknown to them, and their questions
showed much thought and intelligence.
</p>
<p>In the course of the morning they were
led to the stalls where the ship&#8217;s cows were
kept.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What immense goats!&#8221; cried Christian;
&#8220;I did not know there were any of such a

</p>
<p>Just then a little dog, belonging to some
one on board, attracted the attention of one
of the new-comers. &#8220;I know what that is,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that is a dog, I have read of such
things;&#8221; and turning to his companion, &#8220;it
is a pretty thing to look at, is it not?&#8221;

The Captain&#8217;s Cabin.

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>When noon came, the two guests were
taken into the captain&#8217;s cabin to lunch, but
before touching the food which was spread
before them, they both folded their hands,
and without troubling themselves at all
about the presence of the officers, in the
most simple and natural manner asked
God&#8217;s blessing on all that they should eat
and drink.
</p>
<p>Many of those who were present turned
away to hide, not a smile, but a blush of
shame that they, the sons of a Christian
land, should need to be reminded of their
duty to their God by these half-taught
islanders.
</p>
<p>Lunch over, the two captains went on
shore, rowed by their guests, to whose
strong and skilful hands they trusted to
pilot them safely through the dangerous
surf.
</p>
<p>On the beach they were welcomed by
more of the inhabitants, among the rest by
a young girl, the daughter of Adams, who
had evidently come to meet the English
strangers in order that she might learn if
her father was in any danger from them, for
John Adams was the last remaining mutineer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Her confidence was restored by the
looks and words of the two captains, as she
led them, with light step, up the steep
pathway by which alone the interior of the
island could be reached.
</p>
<p>The captains were almost exhausted long
before the top was reached, but their guides
seemed to climb as easily as the goats of
their own island, and even the girls were so
sure-footed that they were able to help the
strangers up the difficult path. Arriving at
the top, a new and beautiful sight delighted
their eyes&mdash;a lovely valley, rich in fruit-bearing
trees, and in cultivated fields, in
the midst of which was built an almost
English-looking village, with its church and
school house, its cottages and gardens, and
all that could speak of a simple, religious
home life. Here they were welcomed by
the remaining inhabitants, with Adams at
their head, to whom all looked up as to
their father. Beside him stood his blind
Tahitian wife, and around him were groups
of young men and girls with bright, intelligent
faces, and smiles which told of the
happiness and innocence of their hearts.

<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever the daughter of Adams may
have feared in her love for her father, he
himself did not appear afraid to receive
these English visitors to his island refuge.
For he felt that as, in the sight of God, his
sin had for Christ&#8217;s sake been pardoned, so
in the eyes of men these long years of penitence,
and of honest endeavor after a better
life, would surely have won pardon for the
sins of his youth. It was with feelings too
deep for words that he looked once more on
the faces of his countrymen and heard the
English speech from other lips than those to
whom he had taught it. All the memories
of early days awoke in him, and he longed
to return once more and see his native land
before he died. But as soon as those round
him understood his wish, they seized his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
hands, they clung around him, praying him
with tears not to desert them, not to leave
his children; and Adams, much moved,
promised to remain. And indeed he would
have been sorely missed had he gone, for
he was the chief authority on the island.
He it was who each Sunday led the prayers
of the islanders, all assembled around him
in the church which they had built, thinking,
as they joined in the words of the service,
of their unknown brethren in the great
country beyond the seas. He it was who
explained week by week the words of the
Bible to his listening companions, taught
the children, and married the young people.
</p>
<p>It was to Adams that every dispute
was referred; all those slight disagreements
which spring up from time to time, but
which with the islanders were never, as they
said, more than word-of-mouth quarrels,
and always ended before set of sun.
</p>
<p>The captains, though anxious to linger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
awhile in this island home, were obliged to
leave next day, and they departed amid the
regrets and farewells of these simple-hearted,
affectionate people, a people Christian in
heart as well as in name,&mdash;sincere, modest,
pure, and unselfish, whose life seemed to
be fashioned on the words of God&#8217;s Book,
&#8220;Look not every man on his own things,
but every man also on the things of others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And all this peace and happiness has
sprung, under the blessing of God, from
the seeds of His truth sown long, long
years before in the hearts of two English
sailors, and from the power of His truth in
His written word, and in the teaching of
His Spirit.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
<h2>NORFOLK ISLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p>Far distant from the many other islands
with which the Southern Pacific Ocean is
studded, one stands alone, rich in natural
beauty, and with a climate almost unrivalled.
</p>
<p>This lovely island was visited by Captain
Cook in 1774, and named by him Norfolk
Island; it was then uninhabited, and neither
the vegetable nor the animal world had been
disturbed. For about two hundred yards
from the shore, the ground was covered so
thickly with shrubs and plants as scarcely
to be penetrable further inland. The account
given by Cook led to an attempt at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
settlement on Norfolk Island; but this was
attended with difficulty. The island is
small, being only about six miles in length
by four in breadth; and was therefore unavailable
for a large or increasing population.
Lying nine hundred miles from Port
Jackson, in Australia, it was inconveniently
remote from that country; and, worst of all,
its cliffy and rocky shores presented serious
dangers to mariners attempting a landing.
Its general unsuitableness, however, for ordinary
colonization, was considered to adapt
it as a penal settlement, subordinate to New
South Wales, and to which convicts could
be sent who merited fresh punishment while
in course of servitude. Thus, one of the
loveliest of earthly paradises was doomed to
be a receptacle for the very worst of malefactors.
It was imagined that the beauty of
Norfolk Island, and the fineness of its climate,
would greatly tend to soothe the depraved
minds of its unhappy tenants, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
reconcile them to compulsory expatriation;
but such was not the case: the feeling uppermost
in the minds of the convicts was
to make their escape; and this, along with
other circumstances, caused the island, after
a time, to be abandoned as a penal settlement.
The narrative that follows may be
relied upon as a true relation of facts, and
will, it is hoped, afford warning to such
as may be tempted to go astray, and deeply
impress those who may be on the verge of
crime, with the danger of their situation,
by showing them that a course of error is a
course of misery, ending in consequences
the most afflicting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the northern side of Norfolk Island,
the cliffs rise high, and are crowned by
woods, in which the elegant whitewood and
gigantic pine predominate. A slight indentation
of the land affords a somewhat sheltered
anchorage-ground, and an opening in
the cliffs has supplied a way to the beach
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
by a winding road at the foot of the dividing
hills. A stream of water, collected from
many ravines, finds its way by a similar
opening to a ledge of rock in the neighborhood,
and, falling over in feathery spray,
has given the name of Cascade to this part
of the island. Off this bay, on the morning
of the 21st of June, 1842, the brig <i>Governor
Philip</i> was sailing, having brought stores for
the use of the penal establishment. It was
one of those bright mornings which this
hemisphere alone knows, when the air is so
elastic that its buoyancy is irresistibly communicated
to the spirits. At the foot of the
cliff, near a group of huge fragments of rock
fallen from the overhanging cliffs, a prisoner
was sitting close to the sea preparing
food for his companions, who had gone off
to the brig the previous evening with ballast,
and who were expected to return at daylight
with a load of stores. The surface of
the sea was smooth, and the brig slowly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
moved on upon its soft blue waters.
Everything was calm and still, when suddenly
a sharp but distant sound as of a gun
was heard. The man, who was stooping
over the fire started on his feet, and looked
above and around him, unable to distinguish
the quarter from whence the report came.
Almost immediately, he heard the sound
repeated, and then distinctly perceived
smoke curling from the vessel&#8217;s side. His
fears were at once excited. Again he listened;
but all was hushed, and the brig
still stood steadily in towards the shore.
Nearer and nearer, she approached; until,
alarmed for her safety, the man ran to summon
the nearest officer. By the time they
returned, the vessel had wore, and was
standing off from the land; but while they
remained in anxious speculation as to the
cause of all this, the firing was renewed on
board, and it was evident that some deadly
fray was going on. At length a boat was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
seen to put off from the brig, and upon its
reaching the shore, the worst fears of the
party were realized. The misguided prisoners
on board had attempted to seize the
vessel. They were but twelve in number,
unarmed, and guarded by twelve soldiers,
and a crew of eighteen men; yet they had
succeeded in gaining possession of the vessel,
and held it for a time, but had been
finally overpowered, and immediate help
was required for the wounded and dying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;June 21, 1842.&mdash;My duty as a clergyman
called me to the scene of blood. When I
arrived on the deck of the brig, it exhibited
a frightful spectacle. My heart sickened
at the extent of the carnage; and I was
almost sinking with the faintness it produced,
when I was roused by a groan so full
of anguish and pain, that for a long time
afterwards its echo seemed to reach me. I
found that it came from a man lying further
forward, on whose face the death-dew was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
standing, yet I could perceive no wound.
Upon questioning him, he moved his hand
from his breast, and I then perceived that a
ball had pierced his chest, and could distinctly
hear the air rushing from his lungs
through the orifice it had left. I tore away
the shirt, and endeavored to hold together
the edges of the wound until it was bandaged.
I spoke to him of prayer, but he
soon grew insensible, and within a short
time died in frightful agony. In every part
of the vessel, evidences of the attempt which
had ended so fatally presented themselves,
and the passions of the combatants were still
warm. After attending to those who required
immediate assistance, I received the
following account of the affair:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The prisoners had slept the previous
night in a part of the vessel appropriated for
this purpose; but it was without fastening or
other means of securing them below. Two
sentries were, however, placed over the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
hatchway. The prisoners occasionally came
on deck during the night, for their launch
was towing astern, and the brig was standing
off and on until the morning. Between
six and seven o&#8217;clock in the morning, the
men were called to work. Two of them
were up some time before the rest. They
were struck by the air of negligence which
was evident on deck, and instantly communicated
the fact to one or two others. The
possibility of capturing the brig had often
been discussed by the prisoners, among
their many other wild plans for escaping
from the island, and recently had been often
proposed by them. The thought was told
by their looks, and soon spread from man
to man. A few moments were enough; one
or two were roused from sleep, and the
intention was hurriedly communicated to
them. It was variously received. One of
them distrusted the leader, and entreated
his companions to desist from so mad an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
attempt. It was useless; the frenzied thirst
for liberty had seized them, and they were
maddened by it. Within a few minutes,
they were all on deck; and one of the
leaders rushing at the sentry nearest to him,
endeavored to wrest from him his pistols,
one of which had flashed in the pan as he
rapidly presented it, and threw him overboard;
but he was subsequently saved. The
arms of the other sentry were demanded,
and obtained from him without resistance.
A scuffle now took place with two other
soldiers who were also on the deck, but not on
duty, during which one of them jumped over
the vessel&#8217;s side, and remained for some
time in the main-chains; but upon the launch
being brought alongside, he went down into
it. The other endeavored to swim ashore
(for by this time the vessel was within a
gun&#8217;s shot of the rocks;) but, encumbered
by his great coat, he was seen, when within
a few strokes of the rock, to raise his hands,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
and uttering a faint cry to Heaven for
mercy, he instantly sunk. In the meanwhile,
the sergeant in charge of the guard
hearing a scuffling overhead, ran upon deck,
and seeing some of the mutineers struggling
with the sentry, shot the nearest of them
dead on the spot. He had no sooner done
so than he received a blow on the head,
which rendered him for some time insensible.
Little or no resistance was offered by
the sailors; they ran into the forecastle, and
the vessel was in the hands of the mutineers.
All the hatches were instantly fastened
down, and every available thing at
hand piled upon them. But now, having
secured their opponents, the mutineers were
unable to work the brig; they therefore
summoned two of the sailors from below,
and placed one of them at the wheel, while
the other was directed to assist in getting
the vessel off. The cockswain, a free man
in charge of the prisoners, had at the first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
onset taken to the rigging, and remained in
the maintop with one of the men who refused
to join in the attack. At this moment, a
soldier who had gone overboard and endeavored
to reach the shore, had turned back,
and was seen swimming near the vessel.
Woolfe, one of the convicts, immediately
jumped into the boat alongside, and saved
him. Whilst this was the state of things
above, the soldiers had forced their way into
the captain&#8217;s cabin, and continued to fire
through the gratings overhead as often as
any of the mutineers passed. In this manner
several of them received wounds. To
prevent a continuance of this, a kettle of hot
water was poured from above; and shortly
afterwards, a proposal was made to the captain
from the prisoners to leave the vessel
in the launch, provided he handed up to
them the necessary supplies. This he refused;
and then all the sailors were ordered
from below into the launch, with the intention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
of sending them ashore. Continuing
to watch for the ring-leaders, the captain
caught a glimpse of one of them standing
aft, and, as he supposed, out of reach. He
mounted the cabin table, and, almost at a
venture, fired through the woodwork in the
direction he supposed the man to be standing.
The shot was fatal; the ball struck
him in the mouth, and passed through his
brain. Terrified at the death of their comrades,
the remainder were panic-struck, and
instantly ran below. One of the leaders
sprung over the taffrail, and eventually
reached the launch. The sailor at the
wheel, now seeing the deck almost cleared,
beckoned up the captain, and without an
effort, the vessel was again in their possession.
In the confusion, a soldier, who had
been in the boat, and was at this moment
with the sailors returning on deck, was
mistaken for one of the mutineers, and shot
by the sergeant. The prisoners were now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
summoned from their place of concealment.
They begged hard for mercy; and upon
condition of their quietly surrendering, it
was promised to them. As the first of
them, in reliance upon this assurance, was
gaining the deck, by some unhappy error,
he received a ball in his thigh, and fell back
again. The rest refused to stir; but after a
few moments&#8217; hesitation, another of them
ventured up, was taken aft by the captain,
and secured. A third followed, and, as he
came up, he extended his arms and cried:
&#8220;I surrender; spare me.&#8221; Either this motion
was mistaken by the soldiers, or some
of them were unable to restrain their passion,
for at this instant the man&#8217;s head was
literally blown off. The captain hastened
to the spot, and received the others, who
were secured without further injury.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we reached the vessel, the dying,
dead, and wounded, were lying in every
direction. In the launch astern, we saw the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
body of one wretched man who had leaped
over the taffrail, and reached the boat badly
wounded; he was seen lying in it when the
deck was regained, and was then pierced
through with many balls. Nothing could be
more horrible than his appearance; the distortion
of every feature, his clenched hands,
and the limbs which had stiffened in the
forms of agony into which pain had twisted
them, were appalling. The countenance of
every man on board bore evidence of the
nature of the deadly conflict in which he
had been engaged. In some, sullenness had
succeeded to reckless daring, and exultation
to alarm in others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could have been more desperate
than such an attempt to seize the vessel.
The most culpable neglect could alone have
encouraged it; and it is difficult to conceive
how it could have succeeded, if anything
like a proper stand had been made by those
in charge of her when it commenced.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The wounded were immediately landed,
and conveyed to the hospital, and the dead
bodies were afterwards brought on shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The burial ground is close to the beach.
A heavy surf rolls mournfully over the reef.
The moon had just risen, when, in deep and
solemn silence, the bodies of these misguided
men were lowered into the graves prepared
for them. Away from home and country,
they had found a fearful termination of a
miserable existence. Perhaps ties had still
bound them to the world; friends whom
they loved were looking for their return,
and, prodigals though they had been, would
have blessed them, and forgiven their offences.
Perhaps even at that sad moment,
mothers were praying for their lost ones,
whom in all their infamy they had still
fondly loved. Such thoughts filled my
mind; and when a few drops of rain at that
moment descended, I could not help thinking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
that they fell as tears from heaven over
the guilt and misery of its children.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the morning following the fatal occurrence,
I visited the jail in which the
mutineers were confined. The cells were
small, but clean and light. In the first of
them, I found George Beavers, Nicholas
Lewis, and Henry Sears. Beavers was
crouching in one corner of the cell, and
looking sullen, and in despair. Lewis, who
was walking the scanty space of the cell,
seemed to glory in the rattle of his heavy
chains; while Sears was stretched, apparently
asleep, upon a grass mat. They were
all heavily ironed, and every precaution had
evidently been taken to prevent escape.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the other cell I found Woolfe and
Barry, the latter in much agony from an
old wound in the leg, the pain of which
had been aggravated by the heavy irons
which galled it. All the prisoners except
Barry and Woolfe, readily acknowledged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
their participation in the attempt to seize
the brig, but most solemnly denied any
knowledge of a preconcerted plan to take
her; or that they at least had attempted to
throw the soldiers overboard. They were
unwilling to be interrupted, and inveighed
in the bitterest manner against some of their
companions who had, they seemed to think,
betrayed them, or at least had led them on,
and at the moment of danger had flinched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The names of the surviving mutineers
were John Jones, Nicholas Lewis, Henry
Sears, George Beavers, James Woolfe,
Thomas Whelan, and Patrick Barry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The depositions against them having
been taken, all the men I have mentioned,
with the exception of Jones and Whelan,
who were wounded, were brought out to
hear them read. They listened with calm
attention, but none of them appeared to be
much excited. Once only during the reading,
Beavers passionately denied the statements
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
made by one of the witnesses present,
and was with difficulty silenced. His countenance
at that moment was terribly agitated;
every bad feeling seemed to mingle in its
passionate expression. They were all young,
powerful, and, with one or two exceptions,
not at all ill-looking men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the jail I proceeded to the hospital,
where the wounded men were lying.
They had each received severe wounds in
the thigh, and were in great agony. The
violence of Jones was excessive. Weakened
in some degree by the loss of blood, the
bitterness of his spirit nevertheless exhibited
itself in passionate bursts of impatience.
He was occasionally convulsed with excessive
pain; for the nerves of the thigh had
been much lacerated, and the bone terribly
shattered. His features were distorted with
pain and anger, and occasionally bitter curses
broke from his lips; yet there was something
about his appearance which powerfully arrested
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
my attention&mdash;an evident marking of
intellect and character, repulsive in its present
development, yet in many respects remarkable.
His history had been a melancholy
one, and, as illustrative of many
thousand others, I give it as I afterwards
received it from his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At eleven years of age, he was employed
in a warehouse in Liverpool as an errand-boy.
While following this occupation, from which,
by good-conduct, he might have risen to
something better, he was met in the street
one day by the lad whom he had succeeded
in this employment, and was told by him
how he might obtain money by robbing the
warehouse, and then go with him to the
theatre. He accordingly took an opportunity
of stealing some articles which had
been pointed out, and gave them to his
companion, who, in disposing of them, was
detected, and of course criminated Jones.
After remaining some weeks in jail, Jones
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
was tried, and acquitted; but his character
being now gone, he became reckless, and
commenced a regular career of depredation.
In attempting another warehouse robbery,
he was detected, and sentenced to twelve
months&#8217; imprisonment. By the time he was
released from this, he was well tutored in
crime, and believed that he could now
adroitly perform the same robbery in which
he had previously failed. He made the
attempt the very night of his release from
jail, and with temporary success. Subsequently,
however, he was detected, and
received sentence of transportation for seven
years. He underwent this sentence, and an
additional one in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land,
chiefly at Port Arthur, the most severe of
the penal stations there. From this place
he, with Lewis, Moss (who was shot on
board the brig), and Woolfe, having seized
a whale-boat, effected their escape. During
three months, they underwent the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
extreme hardships from hunger and exposure.
Once they had been without food for
several days, and their last hook was over
the boat&#8217;s side; they were anxiously watching
for a fish. A small blue shark took the
bait, and in despair one of them dashed over
the boat&#8217;s side to seize the fish; his leg was
caught by one of the others, and they succeeded
in saving both man and hook. They
eventually reached Twofold Bay, on the
coast of New South Wales, and were then
apprehended, conveyed to Sydney, and
thence sent back to Van Diemen&#8217;s Land;
tried, and received sentence of death; but
this was subsequently commuted to transportation
for life to Norfolk Island.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jones often described to me the intense
misery he had undergone during his career.
He had never known what freedom was,
and yet incessantly longed for it. All alike
confessed the unhappiness of their career.
Having made the first false step into crime,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
they acknowledged that their minds became
polluted by the associations they formed
during imprisonment. Then they were further
demoralized by thinking of the <i>glory</i>&mdash;such
miserable glory!&mdash;attending a trial;
and the hulks and the voyage out gave them
a finished criminal training. The extent of
punishment many of them have undergone
during the period of transportation is almost
incredible. I have known men whose original
sentence of seven years has been extended
over three times that period, and who,
in addition to other punishment, have received
five thousand or six thousand lashes!
</p>
<p>&#8220;After many solemn interviews with the
mutineers, I found them gradually softening.
They became more communicative,
and extremely anxious to receive instruction.
I think I shall never forget one of the
earliest of these visits to them. I first saw
Sears, Beavers, and Jones. After a long
and interesting conversation with them, we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
knelt together, and I offered prayer. When
we arose, I perceived that each of them had
been shedding tears. It was the first time
I had seen them betray any such emotion,
and I cannot tell how glad I felt; but when
I proceeded afterwards to read to them the
first chapter of Isaiah, I had scarcely uttered
that most exquisite passage in the second
verse&mdash;&#8221;I have nourished and brougth up
children, and they have rebelled against
me,&#8220;&mdash;when the claims of God, and <i>their</i>
violation and rejection of them; His forbearance,
and <i>their</i> ingratitude, appeared to
overwhelm them; they sobbed aloud, and
were thoroughly overpowered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For a considerable time we talked together
of the past, the wretched years they
had endured, the punishments, and the
crimes which had led to them, until they
seemed to feel most keenly the folly of their
sad career. We passed on to contrast the
manner in which their lives had been spent,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
with what God and society required from
them; their miserable preversion of God&#8217;s
gifts, with the design for which He gave
them, until we were led on to speak of hope
and of faith; of Him who &#8220;willeth not the
death of a sinner, but rather that he should
turn from his wickedness and live;&#8221; and
then the Saviour&#8217;s remonstrance seemed to
arrest them&mdash;&#8220;Ye will not come to me that
ye might have life;&#8221; until at length the
influences of the Holy Spirit were supplicated
with earnestness and solemnity. These
instructions and such conversations were
daily repeated; and henceforth each time I
saw them, I perceived a gradual but distinct
unfolding of the affections and the understanding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;August.&mdash;The wounded men are much
recovered, and the whole of the mutineers
are now confined together in a large ward
of the jail. They have long received extreme
kindness from the commandant, and are literally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
bewildered at finding that even this
last act has not diminished the exercise of
his benevolence. That anybody should care
for them, or take such pains about them
after their violent conduct excited surprise
at first almost amounting to suspicion; but
this at length gave place to the warmest
gratitude. They were, in fact, subdued by
it. They read very much, are extremely
submissive, and carefully avoid the slightest
infringement of the prison regulations. At
first, all this was confined to the three men
I have mentioned; but their steady consistency
of conduct, and the strange transformation
of character, so evident in them,
gradually arrested the attention of the others,
and eventually led to a similar result.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be detained here until the case
has been decided by the authorities in Sydney.
They will probably be tried by a
commission sent from thence to the island
for the purpose. Formerly, however, prisoners
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
charged with capital offences here
were sent up for trial; but (it is a horrible
fact) this was found to lead to so much
crime, that, at much inconvenience and
expense, it was found absolutely necessary
to send down a judicial commission on each
important occasion, in order to prevent it.
The mere excitement of a voyage, with the
chances connected with it, nay, merely a
wish to get off the island even for a time,
led many men to commit crimes of the
deepest dye in order to be sent to Sydney
for trial.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two months, therefore, at least must
intervene between the perpetration of the
offence and their trial; and this interval is
usually employed in similar cases in arranging
a defence but too commonly supported
by perjury. In the present instance, I
found not the slightest attempt to follow
such a course. They declare that they expect
death, and will gladly welcome it. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
their life, which has been a course of almost
constant warfare with society, ending in remorseful
feelings, they were all thoroughly
weary, although only one of them exceeds
thirty years of age.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the ordinary services,
Captain Maconochie, each Sunday afternoon
has read prayers to them, and has given
permission to a few of their friends to be
present. Singular good has resulted from
it, both to the men and those who join in
their devotions. At the conclusion of one
of these services, Sears stood up, and with
his heart so full as scarcely to allow him
utterance, to the surprise of every person
there, he addressed most impressively the
men who were present. &#8216;Perhaps,&#8217; said he,
'the words of one of yourselves, unhappily
circumstanced as I am, may have some
weight with you. You all know the life I
have led; it has, believe me, been a most
unhappy one; and I have, I hope not too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
late, discovered the cause of this. I solemnly
tell you that it is because I have
broken God&#8217;s laws. I am almost ashamed
to speak, but I dare not be silent. I am
going to tell you a strange thing. I never
before was happy; I begin now, for the first
time in my life, to <i>hope</i>. I am an ignorant
man, or at least I was so; but I thank God
I begin to see things in their right light
now. I have been unhappily placed from
my childhood, and have endured many hardships.
I do not mention this to excuse my
errors; yet if I had years since received the
kindness I have done here, it might have
been otherwise. My poor fellows, do turn
over a new leaf; try to serve God, and you,
too, will be happier for it.' The effect was
most thrilling; there was a deathlike silence;
tears rolled down many cheeks, which I verily
believe never before felt them; and without
a word more, all slowly withdrew.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This man&#8217;s story is also a common, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
painful one. At fifteen years of age, he
was transported for life as an accomplice in
an assault and alleged robbery, of which,
from circumstances which have since transpired,
I have little doubt he was entirely
innocent. During a long imprisonment on
Horsham jail, he received an initiation in
crime, which was finished during the outward
voyage. Upon his arrival in New
South Wales, he was assigned to a settler
in the interior, a notoriously hard and severe
man, who gave him but a scanty supply of
food and clothing, and whose aim seemed to
be to take the utmost out of him at the least
possible expense. Driven at length to desperation,
he, with three fellow-servants,
absconded; and when taken, made a complaint
to the magistrate, before whom they
were brought almost without clothes. Their
statements were found to be literally correct;
but for absconding, they were sent to New
Castle, one of the penal stations of New
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
South Wales, where Sears remained nearly
two years. At the expiration of that time,
he was again assigned, but unfortunately to
a man, if possible, worse than his former
employer, and again absconded. For this
offence, he was sent to Moreton Bay, another
penal settlement, and endured three years
of horrible severity, starvation, and misery
of every kind. His temper was by this time
much soured; and, roused by the conduct of
the overseers, he became brutalized by constant
punishment for resisting them. After
this, he was sent to Sydney, as one of the
crew in the police-boat, of which he was
soon made assistant cockswain. For not
reporting a theft committed by one of the
men under his charge, he was sentenced to
a road-party; and attempting to escape from
it, he was apprehended, and again ordered
to Moreton Bay for four years more. There
he was again repeatedly flogged for disobedience
and resistance of overseers, as well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
as attempting to escape; but having most
courageously rendered assistance to a vessel
wrecked off the harbor, he attracted the
attention of the commandant, who afterwards
shewed him a little favor. This was
the first approach to kindness he had known
since when, years before, he had left his
home, and had its usual influence. He was
never again in a scrape there. His good-conduct
induced the commandant to recommend
him for a mitigation of sentence,
which he received, and he was again employed
in the police-boat. The free cockswain
of the boat was, however, a drunkard,
and intrusted much to Sears. Oftentimes
he roused the men by his violence, but Sears
contrived to subdue his passion. At length,
one night, returning to the hut, drunk, the
man struck at one of the crew with his cutlass,
and the rest resisted and disarmed him.
But the morning came; the case was heard;
their story was disbelieved; and upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
charge and evidence of the aggressor, they
were sent to an ironed gang, to work on the
public roads. When Sears again became
eligible for assignment, a person whom he
had known in Sydney applied for him. The
man must be removed within a fixed period
after the authority is given. In this case,
application was made a day beyond the
prescribed time, and churlishly refused.
The disappointment roused a spirit so untutored
as his, and once again he absconded;
was of course apprehended, tried, and being
found with a man who had committed a
robbery, and had a musket in his possession,
was sent to Norfolk Island for life.
This sentence has, however, for meritorious
conduct, been reduced to fourteen years;
and his ready assistance during a fire which
recently broke out in the military garrison
here, might possibly have helped to obtain
a still further reduction. He never, during
those abscondings, was absent for any long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
period, and never committed any act of
violence. His constant attempt seems to
have been to reach Sydney, in order to
effect his escape from the scene of so much
misery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For some time past, I have noticed his
quiet and orderly conduct, and was really
sorry when I found him concerned in this
unhappy affair. His desire for freedom was,
however, most ardent, and a chance of obtaining
it was almost irresistible. He has
since told me that a few words kindly
spoken to himself and others by Captain
Maconochie when they landed, sounded so
pleasantly to him&mdash;such are his own words&mdash;that
he determined from that moment he
would endeavor to do well. He assures
me that he was perfectly unconscious of a
design to take the brig, until awakened from
his sleep a few minutes before the attack
commenced; that he then remonstrated with
the men; but finding it useless, he considered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
it a point of honor not to fail them.
His anxiety for instruction is intense; he
listens like a child; and his gratitude is
most touching. He, together with Jones,
Woolfe, and Barry, were chosen by the
commandant as a police-boat&#8217;s crew; and had,
up to this period, acted with great steadiness
and fidelity in the discharge of the
duties required from them. Nor do I think
they would even now, tempting as the occasion
was, have thought of seizing it, had
it not been currently reported that they
were shortly to be placed under a system of
severity such as they had already suffered
so much from.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woolfe&#8217;s story of himself is most affecting.
He entered upon evil courses when
very young; was concerned in burglaries
when only eleven years of age. Yet this
was from no natural love of crime. Enticed
from his home by boys older than himself,
he soon wearied of the life he led, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
longed to return to his home and his kind
mother. Oftentimes he lingered near the
street she lived in. Once he had been very
unhappy, for he had seen his brother and
sister that day pass near him, and it had
rekindled all his love for them. They appeared
happy in their innocence; he was
miserable in his crime. He now determined
to go home and pray to be forgiven.
The evening was dark and wet, and as he
entered the court in which his friends lived,
his heart failed him, and he turned back;
but, unable to resist the impulse, he again
returned, and stole under the window of the
room. A rent in the narrow curtain enabled
him to see within. His mother sat by the
fire, and her countenance was so sad, that
he was sure she thought of him; but the
room looked so comfortable, and the whole
scene was so unlike the place in which he
had lately lived, that he could no longer
hesitate. He approached the door; the latch
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
was almost in his hand, when shame and
fear, and a thousand other vile and foolish
notions, held him back; and the boy who
in another moment might have been happy&mdash;<i>was
lost</i>. He turned away, and I believe
he has never seen them since. Going on in
crime, he in due course of time was transported
for robbery. His term of seven
years expired in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land.
Released from forced servitude, he went a
whaling-voyage, and was free nearly two
years. Unhappily, he was then charged
with aiding in a robbery, and again received
a sentence of transportation. He was sent
to Port Arthur, there employed as one of
the boat&#8217;s crew, and crossing the bay one
day with a commissariat-officer, the boat
was capsized by a sudden squall. In attempting
to save the life of the officer, he
was seized by his dying grasp, and almost
perished with him; but extricating himself,
he swam back to the boat. Seeing the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
drowning man exhausted, and sinking, he
dashed forward again, diving after him, and
happily succeeded in saving his life. For
this honorable act, he would have received
a remission of sentence; but ere it could
arrive, he and five others made their escape.
He had engaged with these men in the plan
to seize the boat, and although sure of the
success of the application in his favor, he
could not now draw back. The result I
have already shewn. There were two more
men concerned in the mutiny, who, with
those I have mentioned, and those killed on
board the brig, made up the number of the
boat&#8217;s crew. But neither of these men
came under my charge, being both Roman
Catholics.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At length the brig, which had been
despatched with an account of the affair,
returned, and brought the decision of the
governor of New South Wales. He had
found it extremely difficult, almost impossible,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
to obtain fitting members for the
commission, who would be willing to accept
the terms proposed by the government, or
trust themselves in this dreadful place, and
therefore he had determined that the prisoners
should be sent up for trial. The men
were sadly disappointed at this arrangement.
They wished much to end their days here,
and they dreaded both the voyage and the
distracting effect of new scenes. They cling,
too, with grateful attachment to the commandant&#8217;s
family, and the persons who,
during their long imprisonment, had taken
so strong an interest in their welfare. I
determined to accompany them, and watch
for their perseverance in well-doing, that I
might counsel and strengthen them under
the fearful ordeal I could not doubt they
would have to pass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same steady consistency marked
the conduct of these men to the moment of
their embarkation. There was a total absence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of all excitement; one deep, serious
feeling seemed to possess them, and its solemnity
was communicated to all of us.
They spoke and acted as men standing on
the confines of the unseen world, and who
not only thought of its wonders, but, better
still, seemed to have caught something of
its spirit and purity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;November.&mdash;The voyage up was a weary,
and, to the prisoners, a very trying one.
In a prison on the lower deck of a brig of
one hundred and eighty-two tons, fifty-two
men were confined. The place itself was
about twenty feet square, of course, low,
and badly ventilated. The men were all
ironed, and fastened to a heavy chain rove
through iron rings let into the deck, so that
they were unable, for any purpose, to move
from the spot they occupied; scarcely,
indeed, to lie down. The weather was also
unfavorable. The vessel tossed and pitched
most fearfully during a succession of violent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
squalls, accompanied by thunder and lightning.
I cannot describe the wretchedness
of these unhappy convicts; sick, and surrounded
by filth, they were huddled together
in the most disgusting manner. The heat
was at times unbearable. There were
men of sixty&mdash;quiet and inoffensive old
men&mdash;placed with others who were as accomplished
villains as the world could produce.
These were either proceeding to
Sydney, their sentences on the island having
expired, or as witnesses in another case
(a bold and wicked murder) sent there also
for trial. The sailors on board the brig
were for the most part the cowardly fellows
who had so disgracefully allowed the brig
to be taken from them; and they, as well
as the soldiers on guard (some of them
formed a part of the former one), had no
very kindly feeling towards the mutineers.
It may be imagined, therefore, that such
feelings occasioned no alleviation of their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
condition. In truth, although there was no
actual cruelty exhibited, they suffered many
oppressive annoyances; yet I never saw
more patient endurance. It was hard to
bear, but their better principles prevailed.
Upon the arrival of the vessel in Sydney,
we learned that the case had excited an
unusual interest. Crowds assembled to
catch a glimpse of the men as they landed;
and while some applauded their daring, the
great majority very loudly expressed their
horror at the crime of which they stood
accused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think it necessary to describe
the trial, which took place in a few days
after landing. All were arraigned except
Barry. The prisoners&#8217; counsel addressed
the jurors with powerful eloquence; but it
was in vain: the crime was substantiated;
and the jury returned a verdict of guilty
against all of the prisoners, recommending
Woolfe to mercy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;During the whole trial, the prisoners'
conduct was admirable; so much so, indeed,
as to excite the astonishment of the immense
crowd collected by curiosity to see men
who had made so mad an attempt for liberty.
They scarcely spoke, except once to
request that the wounded man, who yet
suffered much pain, might be allowed to sit
down. Judgment was deferred until the
following day. When they were then placed
at the bar, the judge, in the usual manner,
asked whether they had any reason to urge
why sentence should not be pronounced
upon them. It was a moment of deep solemnity;
every breath was held; and the
eyes of the whole court were directed
towards the dock. Jones spoke in a deep,
clear voice, and in a deliberate harangue
pointed out some defects in the evidence,
though without the slightest hope, he said,
of mitigating the sentence now to be pronounced
on himself and fellows. Three of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
the others also spoke. Whelan said, 'that
he was not one of the men properly belonging
to the boat&#8217;s crew, but had been called
upon to fill the place of another man, and
had no knowledge of any intention to take
the vessel, and the part he took on board
was forced upon him. He was compelled
to act as he had done; he had used no violence,
nor was he in any way a participator
in any that had been committed.' At the
conclusion of the address to them, Jones,
amidst the deep silence of the court, pronounced
a most emphatic prayer for mercy
on his own soul, and those of his fellow-prisoners,
for the judge and jury, and finally
for the witnesses. Sentence of death was
then solemnly pronounced upon them all;
but the judge informed Woolfe that he might
hold out to him expectations that his life
would be spared. They were then removed
from the bar, and sent back to the condemned
cells.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot say how much I dreaded my
interview with them that day; for although
I had all along endeavored to prepare their
minds for the worst result, and they had
themselves never for a moment appeared to
expect any other than this, I feared that the
realization of their sad expectation would
break them down. Hitherto, there might
have been some secret hope sustaining them.
The convulsive clinging to life, so common
to all of us, would now, perhaps, be more
palpably exhibited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Entering their cells, I found them, as I
feared, stunned by the blow which had now
fallen on them, and almost overpowered by
mental and bodily exhaustion. A few remarks
about the trial were at length made
by them; and from that moment I never
heard them refer to it again. There was no
bitterness of spirit against the witnesses, no
expression of hostility towards the soldiers,
no equivocation in any explanation they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
gave. They solemnly denied many of the
statements made against them; but, nevertheless,
the broad fact remained, that they
were guilty of an attempt to violently seize
the vessel, and it was useless debating on
minor considerations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime, without their knowledge,
petitions were prepared and forwarded
to the judges, the governor and executive
council. In them were stated various mitigatory
facts in their favor; and the meliorated
character of the criminal code at home was also
strongly urged. Every attention was paid to
these addresses, following each other to the
last moment. But all was in vain. The council
sat, and determined that five of the men
should be hanged on the following Tuesday.
Whelan, who could have no previous knowledge
of a plan to seize the vessel, together
with Woolfe, was spared. The remaining
four were to suffer. The painful office of
communicating this final intelligence to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
these men was intrusted to me, and they
listened to the announcement not without
deep feeling, but still with composure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be very painful for me to
dwell on the closing scene. The unhappy
and guilty men were attended by the zealous
chaplain of the jail, whose earnest exhortations
and instructions they most gratefully
received. The light of truth shone clearly
on the past, and they felt that their manifold
lapses from the path of virtue had been
the original cause of the complicated misery
they had endured. They entreated forgiveness
of all against whom they had offended,
and in the last words to their friends, were
uttered grateful remembrances to Captain
Maconochie, his family, and others. At
the place of execution, they behaved with
fortitude and a composure befitting the solemnity
of the occasion. Having retired
from attendance upon them in their last
moments, I was startled from the painful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
stupor which succeeded in my own mind,
by the loud and heavy bound of the drop
as it fell, and told me that their spirits had
gone to God who gave them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Since the foregoing narrative was written,
the treatment of convicts has undergone
considerable change, government having
found the experiment of transporting the
worse class of criminals from New South
Wales to Norfolk Island to be a failure.
The penal settlement was therefore broken
up in 1855, and convicts are now confined
in different establishments in the United
Kingdom, where, without subjecting them
to absolute silence or solitude, they are separated
from the contaminating society of each
other. Under the present system, it is a
fixed principle never to allow, if at all possible,
the punishment&mdash;while it may be
made to any extent disagreeable&mdash;to injure
either the body or the mind.

<h2>THE SOLITARY ISLANDER.</h2>
</div>

<p>It was at the time Queen Anne began to
reign, and her ships were carrying the English
flag into all seas, for commerce, for
discovery, or for war, when one of these
vessels, called the <i>Clinque Ports</i>, put in to
refit at the uninhabited island of Juan Fernandez,
on the west coast of South America.
</p>
<p>It was but a small island, though fertile
and pleasant; it had not been tilled or
planted, neither had any place of shelter
been built upon it, but sometimes two or
three sick sailors had been left there to recover
health, and sometimes a passing ship
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
would put in for water, and departing leave
one or two of their live-stock on the island.
It had thus become stocked with goats,
which ran wild about the hills and craggy
rocks, free from any danger of pursuit and
capture.
</p>
<p>This was not the first time that the
<i>Clinque Ports</i> had touched at Juan Fernandez,
for not long before she had left there
two seamen who were unable to continue
their voyage, and now she had anchored to
reship these men, to take in water, and to
refit for the long and perilous voyage to
the English shore.
</p>
<p>The two seamen, coming on board, told
strange stories to their comrades of the
pleasant life they had led on the island, of
the hunt for goats, of the abundance of
shell-fish, of the delicious fruits and vegetables,
and of the cool waters of the place.
</p>
<p>Of all the eager listeners to these tales of
plenty and delight, there was one who never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
failed to fasten on each word that was said,
and by constant questioning, to learn every
detail of the life on the green island which
lay before them. This sailor was a Scotsman,
named Alexander Selkirk or Selcraig.
He was of an impatient, overbearing temper,
and no favorite with his captain, who was
not wise enough to discern the good sense
and honesty which lay hidden under his
rough and uncourteous manner. Thus it
chanced that the Scotch Sailor was often in
trouble and disgrace, and resenting bitterly
a harshness he did not think he had deserved,
he began to long to leave the ship
at any cost.
</p>
<p>But perhaps the beginning of his misery
and discomfort must be sought farther back
in his life. His surly speech, his unsocial
temper, spoke of a mind ill at ease,&mdash;the
remembrance of the past made the present
sad.
</p>
<p>He had been religiously and strictly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
brought up by his father, a Scotch Puritan,
but he had broken loose from the restraints
which his parents sought to throw around
him, and had led, if not a vicious, at least
an irreligious life, without thought of God,
or of the lessons of truth and goodness which
he had been taught. Yet his conscience was
not so hardened that he could be happy in
this neglect of God, and he felt ill at
ease, dissatisfied with himself, and with all
around him.
</p>
<p>He shrank, too, from the prospect of the
voyage to England in a vessel but half repaired,
exaggerating to his own mind the
perils before him, and fearful of his own
temper with his hard and prejudiced commander.
</p>
<p>Weighing all these things, he determined
on asking the captain to set him on shore,
that he might wait at Juan Fernandez the
passing of some other ship in which he might
return home. The captain agreed to this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
proposal willingly enough, glad to dismiss
from his crew so insubordinate a sailor; and
just before the <i>Clinque Ports</i> was about to
weigh anchor, the adventurous seaman was
sent on shore with the few things that belonged
to him. He sprang from the boat
almost before her keel had grazed the sand,
wishing to appear gay and brave to his
companions; but no sooner did the splash
of oars begin to grow faint and distant, and
the faces of the boatmen indistinct as they
neared the ship, than all his courage forsook
him. With outstretched hands, and frantic
words and gestures, he implored them to
return, promising to bear everything, to
risk everything, if only he might not be left
alone on the lonely island. But he cried in
vain; the boat reached the ship, the men
climbed on board, the sails were hoisted, and
there on his sea-chest, sat the lonely sailor,
gazing over the wide ocean, on which nothing
but the lessening speck of white on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
far horizon reminded him of the existence
of any human being but himself.
</p>
<p>Days passed almost uncounted, for in his
desolate misery Alexander Selkirk had but
one thought left&mdash;the longing desire of rescue
and return home. He valued the daylight
only because by its aid he could watch
for a sail on the wide, silent sea; he dreaded
the coming on of the night, chiefly because
it shut him off for a time from his one employment.
During these dreary days or
weeks he never tasted food, save when
driven to look for it by pangs of sharpest
hunger, and even then he would not leave
the beach, but fed on shell-fish picked up
on the rocks, or sometimes on the flesh of
seals.
</p>
<p>It was September when the <i>Clinque Ports</i>
sailed, and now October had come, the
middle of spring in Juan Fernandez, and,
all round him, nature spoke of hope, and
taught of God. But before hope could enter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
into Alexander&#8217;s desolate heart, sorrow must
come: sorrow for sin, for his disobedience
to the parents whom he had made unhappy;
for his reckless, godless life; for all the
teachings of his youth forgotten, and for its
lessons neglected. Sometimes, for a few
minutes, Alexander would turn his eyes
from his eager watch over the sea, and
looking down, would picture instead his
Scottish home. He would see clearly in his
mind his venerable father, with his furrowed
brow, and stern, unsmiling mouth; his
mother, in her tall white cap, busied at her
wheel, with a far-away, mournful look in
her eyes, which told that she was thinking
of her absent son. Ah! and he saw again
even his poor idiot brother, to whom he
had only used harsh words, and even rough
blows. &#8220;I would be so different now if it
should please God ever to let me see home
and my dear ones again,&#8221; he thought. And
so has many a poor prodigal thought as he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
has been compelled to suffer the punishment
for his sins, and found no way to escape
from it.
</p>
<p>Little by little, there grew up in his
heart the purpose of beginning even now
this new life. He would not wait till his
return to England. In this lonely island,
with half the world between him and all he
loved, he would strive to be one with them
in heart, and to join with them in prayer
and praise. He would seek pardon for the
sins of his youth for the Saviour&#8217;s sake, and
in His strength, begin life anew. He had
a Bible with him in his chest, and he began
to read it daily, and in earnest prayer to
seek forgiveness and blessing; then, even in
his loneliness, comfort came to him. He
was no longer alone, for God was with him.
He knew that God was his Father, his
Helper, and his Keeper, and he grew calm,
almost happy, and was even able sometimes
to leave his look-out over the sea, and make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
little journeys into the interior of his new
kingdom.
</p>
<p>As his mind became more peaceful, he
turned his thoughts to the question of a
shelter from the storms of the approaching
winter, which, even in that mild climate,
was often accompanied with frost and snow.
There were plenty of trees on the island,
and with their stems and branches he soon
built for himself a rough hut, which he
thatched with long grass cut and dried in
the sun. This attempt was so successful
that he determined to build another hut at
a short distance, so that he might sleep in
one, and in the other, prepare his food.
Now that he had once looked in the face the
thought of spending the winter in the
island, he grew, slowly, more reconciled to
it, and began to take an interest in preparing,
as far as he could, for its approach.
</p>
<p>His huts must be furnished in some fashion;
first, he brought up from the shore his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
sea-chest, which contained his few clothes;
then he cut and fastened up a shelf on
which to keep his Bible and the other
books which he had brought on shore. He
had with him a large cooking-pot in which
to prepare his food, and a smaller drinking-can
which he had brought, most likely, from
home, and which bore the old-fashioned inscription,
&#8220;Alexander Selkirk, this is my
one.&#8221; It was needful to make for himself
a bed, for hitherto he had slept on the
beach, so that at the first moment of opening
his eyes he might begin his watch over the
sea: now he must sleep in his hut.
</p>
<p>This bed he determined to make of the
skins of goats, for he had begun to hunt the
wild goats for food, having by this time
wearied of his diet of fish. At first he was
able only to overtake and capture the young
kids, for he had no gun, no bow and arrow
with which to kill them at a distance;
then as exercise and practice increased his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
strength, he found himself able to pursue
and take the largest and swiftest goats, and
having killed them, to carry them on his
shoulders to his hut. But as goat&#8217;s flesh,
his principal food, could only be obtained
by him while he remained in full strength
and vigor, he determined to provide a store
in case of illness or accident, and so, catching
several young kids, he slightly lamed
them, so that they could move but slowly, and
then trained them to feed around his hut,
and these gentle creatures, who soon learned
to know him, brought some sense of companionship
to the lonely man.
</p>
<p>His life began now to have its regular
duties and interests. In the morning when
he rose, he sang one of the old Scotch
psalms, after the practice which he had been
taught from childhood, and then read aloud
a chapter of the Bible, and prayed long
and fervently.
</p>
<p>Then he betook himself to light a fire by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
rubbing together two dry sticks till a flame
was produced, and this fire he fed from
time to time with branches and logs from
the woods. He had also, his food to obtain
and to cook&mdash;goat&#8217;s flesh or cray-fish, which
he boiled in his large sauce-pan; and to
gather the tender tops of the cabbage-palm
or other vegetables, for bread. These necessary
employments finished, he would take
his Bible, and, sitting in the door of his
hut, or on the beach, would study it for
hours, finding new truths and deeper meaning
in the blessed words familiar to him
from his childhood. Or he would choose
one of his books on navigation, and study
with a care which he had never before
thought it worth while to give, hoping in
this way to be a better sailor, and be able
to take higher rank in the service, if it
should please God to restore him once
more to the duties and work of life. In
this regular, peaceful, and religious life his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
spirits gradually recovered; nay, he became
far happier than he had been since his
childhood, for something of the trust and
the love of a little child were restored to his
heart.
</p>
<p>He would adorn his hut with fragrant
boughs, and as he fed and caressed his kids,
would sing with a light heart the songs of
old Scotland. Then at set of sun he returned
to the hut in which he slept, and
there once more sang, and read, and prayed,
and so lay down to sleep in peace, because
he knew that it was the Lord only that
made him dwell in safety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a better Christian in my solitude
than ever I was before, or than I fear I
shall ever be again,&#8221; he said, years after he
had left the island. In this there was both
truth and error. He had been led by the
merciful goodness of God to repentance and
to an earnest desire to escape from sin, but
it was in the life among his fellows that this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
repentance and these new resolves&mdash;must be
tested. It was in the daily little trials and
crosses of a life among other men, that he
must learn to subdue his proud spirit, and
curb his hot temper.
</p>
<p>Months and even years passed on, and
but little happened to vary Alexander&#8217;s
quiet life in his island home. He had now
a large number of kids around his hut, and
had added to his list of favorites several
tamed cats, which he needed to protect him
from the troop of rats which gnawed his
bed-clothes, and even nibbled at his feet as
he lay asleep. He had taught the kids and
cats, too, to dance, and many a merry hour
he spent among these his daily companions
and friends. The clothes which he had
brought on shore had been long since worn
out, and he had supplied their place by a cap,
and trousers, and jacket, made of goat-skin.
His needle was a nail, and his thread thin
strips of the skin; among his stores was a
piece of linen, and this too he had sewn
into shirts, unravelling one of his stockings
for a supply of thread. He was barefoot,
and the soles of his feet had grown so hard
that he could climb sharp crags, and run
over the stony beach, unhurt.
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
A narrow escape.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Twice or thrice during these lonely years
he had seen a sail approaching, but on these
he looked with as much terror as hope, for
should the crew prove to be Spaniards, he
knew that he should be made a prisoner by
them, and either put to death, or sent into
hopeless slavery.
</p>
<p>Once, indeed, the crew of a Spanish vessel,
putting in for water, had caught sight
of the strange figure in the goat-skin dress,
and had chased him, but so swift-footed was
he that he soon left his pursuers far behind,
and then lay hid in terror for hours, till the
vessel had departed. His life had been
besides in other danger, for once while
pursuing the hunt from crag to crag, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
wild and delightful adventure, he had set
foot on the hidden edge of a precipice: the
grass which seemed to promise so fair a
footing gave way beneath his feet, he fell
headlong, and lay hurt and senseless below.
He judged by the size of the moon, when
at last he opened his eyes to consciousness,
that he must have been lying stunned and
helpless for more than twenty-four hours,
and it was with the greatest pain and difficulty
that he could drag himself to his hut,
and lie down on his bed of skins. His tame
favorites came about him but none of them
could help him, and he was too weak to
care to procure for himself food or water.
But even in his great distress he did not
lose his confidence in God, and he lay calm
and patient, satisfied that he was safe in the
care of his Heavenly Father. After many
days of suffering he recovered and once
more enjoyed full health and vigor.
</p>
<p>He had been alone on Juan Fernandez for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
more than four years when one evening,
looking out seaward before lying down in
his hut, he saw the sails of an English-built
vessel which was standing in very
near to the shore. Alexander could not
resist the sudden and strong desire which
he felt, to be once more among his fellow-men,
to hear once more the English speech,
and feel once more the grasp of a friendly
hand. Hurrying down to the beach, he
piled and lighted a large bonfire, to carry a
message to his fellow-countrymen, but the
ship, instead of sailing shoreward, or of
putting off a boat at once, tacked and went
farther from the island, taking the fire to
be the lights of an enemy&#8217;s ship at anchor
in the bay.
</p>
<p>Alexander spent the night in hope and in
doubt: he killed some goats and prepared
them for food, hoping the next day to entertain
some of his countrymen in his island
home, and at the first dawn of day he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
again on the beach, gazing at the now distant
but motionless ship.
</p>
<p>Those on board were also keeping an
anxious watch, but when morning light
showed them that there was no other ship
near, the captain determined to send a boat
on shore to discover the cause of the strange
light which they had seen the night before.
As they approached the island they saw a
strange figure running to meet them, and
by gestures and shouts pointing out the best
place for landing. Alexander, with his
long beard, his tanned complexion, his goat-skin
dress, had lost almost all outward resemblance
to a civilized man, and they
wondered much who this friendly and solitary
savage might be.
</p>
<p>But who can describe his joy when he
heard once more the speech of his own
country, and looked on the faces of his
kind. He welcomed his visitors in the best
English he could remember, for even his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
speech was half forgotten, and led them to
his hut to partake of the banquet he had
prepared.
</p>
<p>Yet in the midst of all his joy he could
hardly determine to leave his beloved island,
so accustomed had he grown to solitude, and
to his wild, uncontrolled life. At length
the remembrance of his aged parents, and
of his friends at home, made him determine
to ask a passage in the ship which had
touched on his island shore, and the captain,
finding how much he had learnt of seamanship
and navigation, offered to rate him as
mate. And thus Juan Fernandez was left
once more in utter solitude, and Selkirk,
gazing from the ship&#8217;s deck, saw its green
hills and pleasant coasts disappear in the
distance, as he left the island and all its
sad, its sacred, its happy memories forever.
He soon grew tired of the society of men,
and when not busy about the ship, would
always seek to be alone, dreaming of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
life which he had left. He found it hard,
too, to accustom himself to the salt meat
and biscuits which were sailors&#8217; fare, and
to the dress and boots in which he must now
appear. Soon every other thought was lost
in his longing desire to see once more his
parents and his home, for the shores of
England were in sight. It was on a Sunday
morning that the wanderer entered once
more his native village, where all seemed
quiet and unchanged. He did not turn his
steps to his father&#8217;s cottage, for his parents,
as he well knew, would be at the kirk, and
there would he look on their faces once
more. Would they recognize, he asked
himself, in the strong and bearded man,
the youth who had left them years ago for
the life of adventure which he loved best?
Would they know the fine gentleman in
gold lace and embroidery to be their son
Alexander, their lost sailor lad. Pondering
such thoughts as these, he walked on almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
unconsciously. How well he knew every
step of his way! In this farmhouse, his
sister and her husband used to live; there
was the wood where he had so often gathered
nuts, or climbed for birds&#8217; nests with
his boyish companions; there, its thatched
roof more lichen-covered than of old, stood
his father&#8217;s cottage, at the door of which
years ago he had kissed his mother for the
last time&mdash;ah! was she still alive to welcome
the returning wanderer?
</p>
<p>Seated in the kirk among unfamiliar
faces, his eyes sought at once the well-known
corner where, as a boy, he had been
used to sit, and with an almost overwhelming
rush of thankfulness and joy he saw
once more his mother&#8217;s face, the same, yet
changed, its added wrinkles and silvered
hair telling, perhaps, of many tears and
long sorrow for her lost sailor son.
</p>
<p>There sat his father, too, the portly,
respectable-looking elder, in blue cap and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
coat of homespun tweed. In vain did Alexander
seek to join in the psalm or prayer,
his looks and thoughts were ever wandering;
and he was not alone in this, for the
dark eyes of his old mother turned continually
with an eager, inquiring gaze to the
grand stranger gentleman, strange yet so
familiar. Then her eyes were cast down
once more on her book, as she tried to give
heed to the service, till at last a sudden
smile which lit up Alexander&#8217;s face, showed
her that she saw before her the son for
whom she had longed and prayed, whom no
doubt she had before this counted as among
the dead. In her sudden joy the old woman
forgot all else, and rising, rushed towards
the place where the returned wanderer was
seated.
</p>
<p>The whole family, with Alexander in their
midst, now made their way out of the kirk,
and returned home to talk of the great deliverance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
which God had given to their lost
kinsman.
</p>
<p>On this true story of Selkirk was founded
the tale of the Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
<h2>CAPTAIN COOK'S LAST VOYAGE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The discovery of a supposed north-west
passage from the North Atlantic to the
North Pacific Oceans, had for many years
been ardently sought for, both by the English
and the Dutch. Frobisher, in 1576, made
the first attempt, and his example was in
succeeding times followed by many others.
But though much geographical information
had been gained in the neighborhood of
Hudson&#8217;s Bay, Davis&#8217; Strait, Baffin&#8217;s Bay,
and the coast of Greenland, yet no channel
whatever was found. By act of parliament,
£20,000 was offered to the successful individual.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
But though Captain Middleton,
in 1741, and Captains Smith and Moore, in
1746, explored those seas and regions, the
object remained unattained. The Honorable
Captain Phipps (afterwards Earl Mulgrave)
was sent out in the <i>Racehorse</i>, accompanied
by Captain Lutwidge, in the <i>Carcase</i> (Lord
Nelson was a boy in this latter ship), to
make observations, and to penetrate as far
as it was practicable to do so. They sailed
June 2, 1773, and made Spitzbergen on the
28th; but after great exertions, they found
the ice to the northward utterly impenetrable.
Once they became closely jammed,
and it was only with great difficulty they
escaped destruction. On August 22, finding
it impossible to get further to the northward,
eastward, or westward, they made
sail, according to their instructions, for England,
and arrived off Shetland on September
7.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these numerous failures,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
the idea of an existing passage was still cherished;
and Earl Sandwich continuing at the
head of the Admiralty, resolved that a
further trial should be made, and Captain
Cook offered his services to undertake it.
They were gladly accepted, and on February
10, 1776, he was appointed to command the
expedition in his old, but hardy ship, the
<i>Resolution</i>, and Captain Clerke, in the <i>Discovery</i>,
was ordered to attend him. In this
instance, however, the mode of experiment
was to be reversed, and instead of attempting
the former routes by Davis&#8217; Strait or
Baffin&#8217;s Bay, etc., Cook, at his own request,
was instructed to proceed into the South
Pacific, and thence to try the passage by
the way of Behring&#8217;s Strait; and as it was
necessary that the islands in the Southern
Ocean should be revisited, cattle and sheep,
with other animals, and all kinds of seeds,
were shipped for the advantage of the
natives.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>Every preparation having been made, the
<i>Resolution</i> quitted Plymouth on July 12, taking
Omai, the native, from the Society Isles.
Having touched at Teneriffe, they crossed
the equator September 1, and reached the
Cape on October 18, where the <i>Discovery</i>
joined them on November 10.
</p>
<p>The ships sailed again on November 30,
and encountered heavy gales, in which several
sheep and goats died. On December
12 they saw two large islands, which Cook
named Prince Edward&#8217;s Islands; and three
days afterwards several others were seen;
but having made Kerguelen&#8217;s Land, they
anchored in a convenient harbor on Christmas
day. On the north side of this harbor one
of the men found a quart bottle fastened to
a projecting rock by stout wire, and on
opening it, the bottle was found to contain
a piece of parchment, on which was an inscription
purporting that the land had been
visited by a French vessel in 1772-3. To
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
this Cook added a notice of his own visit;
the parchment was then returned to the bottle,
and the cork being secured with lead,
was placed upon a pile of stones near to the
place from which it had been removed. The
whole country was extremely barren and
desolate, and on the 30th they came to the
eastern extremity of Kerguelen&#8217;s Land.
</p>
<p>On January 24, 1777, they came in sight
of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land (now Tasmania),
and on the 26th anchored in Adventure Bay,
where intercourse was opened with the natives,
and Omai took every opportunity of
lauding the great superiority of his friends,
the English. Here they obtained plenty of
grass for the remaining cattle, and a supply
of fresh provisions for themselves. On the
30th they quitted their port, convinced that
Van Diemen&#8217;s Land was the southern point
of New Holland. Subsequent investigations,
however, have proved this idea to be erroneous,
Van Diemen&#8217;s Land being an island
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
separated from the mainland of Australia by
Bass&#8217;s Strait.
</p>
<p>On February 12, Captain Cook anchored
at his old station in Queen Charlotte&#8217;s Sound,
New Zealand; but the natives were very shy
in approaching the ships, and none could be
persuaded to come on board. The reason
was, that on the former voyages, after parting
with the <i>Resolution</i>, the <i>Adventure</i> had visited
this place, and ten of her crew had
been killed in an unpremeditated skirmish
with the natives. It was the fear of retaliatory
punishment that kept them aloof.
Captain Cook, however, soon made them
easy upon the subject, and their familiarity
was renewed; but great caution was used,
to be fully prepared for a similar attack, by
keeping the men well-armed on all occasions.
Of the animals left at this island in the
former voyages, many were thriving; and
the gardens, though left in a state of nature,
were found to contain cabbages, onions,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
leeks, radishes, mustard, and a few potatoes.
The captain was enabled to add to
both. At the solicitation of Omai, he received
two New Zealand lads on board the
<i>Resolution</i>, and by the 27th was clear of the
coast.
</p>
<p>After landing at a number of islands,
and not finding adequate supplies, the ships
sailed for Anamocka, and the <i>Resolution</i> was
brought up in exactly the same anchorage
that she had occupied three years before.
The natives behaved in a most friendly manner,
and but for their habits of stealing,
quiet would have been uninterrupted. Nothing,
however, could check this propensity,
till Captain Cook shaved the heads of all
whom he caught practicing it. This rendered
them an object of ridicule to their
countrymen, and enabled the English to recognize
and keep them at a distance. Most
of the Friendly Isles were visited by the
ships, and everywhere they met with a kind
reception. On June 10 they reached Tongataboo,
where the King offered Captain
Cook his house to reside in. Here he made
a distribution of animals amongst the chiefs,
and the importance of preserving them was
explained by Omai. Two kids and two
turkey-cocks having been stolen, the captain
seized three canoes, put a guard over the
chiefs, and insisted that not only the kids
and turkeys should be restored, but also
everything that had been taken away since
their arrival. This produced a good effect,
and much of the plunder was returned.
</p>

Deliverance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 194.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Cook remained at the Friendly
Islands nearly three months, and lived
almost entirely during that period upon
fresh provisions, occasionally eating the produce
of the seeds he had sown there in his
former visits. On July 17, they took their
final leave of these hospitable people, and
on August 12 reached Otaheite, and took up a
berth in Oaiti-piha Bay, which, it was discovered,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
had been visited by two Spanish
ships since the <i>Resolution</i> had last been
there.
</p>
<p>Animals of various kinds had been left in
the country by the Spaniards, and the islanders
spoke of them with esteem and respect.
On the 24th the ships went round to Matavai
Bay, and Captain Cook presented to the
king, Otoo, the remainder of his live stock.
</p>
<p>They here witnessed a human sacrifice, to
propitiate the favor of their gods in a battle
they were about to undertake. The victim
was generally some strolling vagabond, who
was not aware of his fate till the moment
arrived, and he received his death-blow from
a club. For the purpose of showing the
inhabitants the use of the horses, Captains
Cook and Clerke rode into the country, to
the great astonishment of the islanders; and
though this exercise was continued every day
by some of the <i>Resolution&#8217;s</i> people, yet the
wonder of the natives never abated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>On the return of Omai to the land of his
birth, the reception he met with was not
very cordial; but the affection of his relatives
was strong and ardent. Captain Cook
obtained the grant of a piece of land for
him on the west side of Owharre harbor,
Huaheine. The carpenters of the ships built
him a small house, to which a garden was
attached, planted with shaddocks, vines,
pineapples, melons, etc., and a variety
of vegetables, the whole of which were
thriving before Captain Cook quitted the
island. When the house was finished, the
presents Omai had received in England were
carried ashore, with every article necessary
for domestic purposes, as well as two muskets,
a bayonet, a brace of pistols, etc.
</p>
<p>The two lads brought from New Zealand
were put on shore at this place, to form part
of Omai&#8217;s family; but it was with great reluctance
that they quitted the voyagers, who
had behaved so kindly to them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>Whilst lying at Huaheine, a thief, who
had caused them great trouble, not only
had his head and beard shaved, but, in
order to deter others, both his ears were cut
off. On November 3, the ships went to
Ulietea, and here, decoyed by the natives,
two or three desertions took place; and as
others seemed inclined to follow the example,
Captain Clerke pursued the fugitives
with two-armed boats and a party of marines,
but without effect. Captain Cook
experienced a similar failure; he therefore
seized upon the persons of the chief&#8217;s son,
daughter, and son-in-law, whom he placed
under confinement till the people should be
restored, which took place on the 28th, and
the hostages were released. One of the deserters
was a midshipman of the <i>Discovery</i>,
and the son of a brave officer in the service.
Schemes were projected by some of the
natives to assassinate Captain Cook and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
Captain Clerke; but though in imminent
danger, the murderous plans failed.
</p>
<p>At Bolabola, Captain Cook succeeded in
obtaining an anchor which had been left
there by M. Bougainville, as he was very
desirous of converting the iron into articles
of traffic. They left this place on December
8, crossed the line, and on the 24th stopped
at a small island, which he named Christmas
Island, and where he planted cocoa-nuts,
yams, and melon seeds, and left a bottle
enclosing a suitable inscription.
</p>
<p>On January 2, 1778, the ships resumed
their voyage northward, to pursue the grand
object in Behring&#8217;s Strait. They passed
several islands, the inhabitants of which,
though at a great distance from Otaheite,
spoke the same language. Those who came
on board displayed the utmost astonishment
at everything they beheld, and it was evident
they had never seen a ship before.
The disposition to steal was equally strong
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
in these as in the other South Sea islanders,
and a man was killed who tried to plunder
the watering-party, but this was not known to
Captain Cook till after they had sailed. They
also discovered that the practice of eating
human flesh was prevalent. To a group of
these islands (and they were generally found
in clusters) Captain Cook gave the name of
the Sandwich Islands, in honor of the noble
earl at the head of the Admiralty.
</p>
<p>The voyage to the northward was continued
on February 2, and the long-looked-for
coast of New Albion was made on March 7;
the ships, after sailing along it till the 29th,
came to anchor in a small cove. A brisk
trade commenced with the natives, who appeared
to be well acquainted with the value
of iron, for which they exchanged the skins
of various animals, such as bears, wolves,
foxes, deer, etc., both in their original state
and made up into garments. But the most
extraordinary articles were human skulls,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
and hands not quite stripped of the flesh,
and which had the appearance of having been
recently on the fire. Thieving was practiced
at this place in a more scientific manner
than they had before remarked; and the
natives insisted upon being paid for the
wood and other things supplied to the ships,
with which Captain Cook scrupulously complied.
This inlet was named King George&#8217;s
Sound, but it was afterwards ascertained
that the natives called it Nootka Sound.
After making every requisite nautical observation,
the ships being again ready for sea
on the 26th, in the evening they departed, a
severe gale of wind blowing them away from
the shore. From this period they examined
the coast, under a hope of finding some communication
with the Polar Sea; one river
they traced a long distance, which was afterwards
named Cook&#8217;s River.
</p>
<p>They left this place June 6, but notwithstanding
all their watchfulness and vigilance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
no passage could be found. The
ships ranged across the mouth of the strait.
The natives of the islands, by their manners,
gave evident tokens of their being acquainted
with Europeans&mdash;most probably Russian
traders. They put in at Oonalaska and other
places, which were taken possession of in
the name of the King of England. On
August 3, Mr. Anderson, surgeon of the
<i>Resolution</i>, died from a lingering consumption,
under which he had been suffering
more than twelve months. He was a young
man of considerable ability, and possessed an
amiable disposition.
</p>
<p>Proceeding to the northward, Captain
Cook ascertained the relative position of the
two continents, Asia and America, whose
extremities he observed. On the 18th they
were close to a dense wall of ice, beyond
which they could not penetrate. The ice
here was from ten to twelve feet high, and
seemed to rise higher in the distance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
A prodigious number of sea-horses were
crouching on the ice, some of which were
procured for food. Captain Cook continued
to traverse these icy seas till the 29th.
He then explored the coasts in Behring&#8217;s
Strait both in Asia and America; and on
October 2 again anchored at Oonalaska to
refit; and here they had communication
with some Russians, who undertook to convey
charts and maps, etc., to the English
Admiralty, which they faithfully fulfilled.
On the 26th the ships quitted the harbor of
Samganoodah, and sailed for the Sandwich
Islands, Captain Cook purposing to remain
there a few months, and then return to
Kamtschatka. The island of Mowee was
discovered on November 26; and on the 30th
they fell in with another, called by the natives
Owyhee (now Hawaii); and being of large
extent, the ships were occupied nearly seven
weeks in sailing round it, and examining the
coast; and they found the islanders more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
frank and free from suspicion than any they
had yet had intercourse with; so that on January
16, 1779, there were not fewer than a
thousand canoes about the two ships, most of
them crowded with people, and well-laden
with hogs and other productions of the
place. A robbery having been committed,
Captain Cook ordered a volley of musketry
and four great guns to be fired over the canoe
that contained the thief; but this seemed
only to astonish the natives, without creating
any great alarm. On the 17th the ships
anchored in a bay called by the islanders,
Karakakooa. The natives constantly thronged
to the ships, whose decks, consequently,
being at all times crowded, allowed of
pilfering without fear of detection; and
these practices, it is conjectured, were
encouraged by the chiefs. A great number
of the hogs purchased were killed and salted
down so completely, that some of the pork
was good at Christmas, 1780. On the 26th,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Captain Cook had an interview with Terreeoboo,
King of the islands, in which great
formality was observed, and an exchange of
presents took place, as well as an exchange of
names. The natives were extremely respectful
to Cook; in fact, they paid him a sort
of adoration, prostrating themselves before
him; and a society of priests furnished the
ships with a constant supply of hogs and
vegetables, without requiring any return.
On February 3, the day previous to the
ships sailing, the King presented them with
a quantity of cloth, many boat-loads of vegetables,
and a whole herd of hogs. The
ships sailed on the following day, but on the
6th encountered a very heavy gale, in which,
on the night of the 7th, the <i>Resolution</i> sprung
the head of her foremast in such a dangerous
manner, that they were forced to put back
to Karakakooa Bay, in order to get it repaired.
Here they anchored on the morning
of the 11th, and everything for a time promised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
to go well in their intercourse with the
natives. The friendliness manifested by the
chiefs, however, was far from solid. They
were savages at a low point of cultivation,
and theft and murder were not considered
by them in the light of crimes. Cook,
aware of the nature of these barbarians, was
anxious to avoid any collision, and it was
with no small regret that he found that an
affray had taken place between some seamen
and the natives. The cause of the disturbance
was the seizure of the cutter of the
<i>Discovery</i> as it lay at anchor. The boats of
both ships were sent in search of her, and
Captain Cook went on shore to prosecute the
inquiry, and, if necessary, to seize the person
of the King, who had sanctioned the
theft.
</p>
<p>The narrative of what ensued is affectingly
tragical. Cook left the <i>Resolution</i> about
seven o&#8217;clock, attended by the lieutenant of
marines, a sergeant, a corporal, and seven
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
private men. The pinnace&#8217;s crew were likewise
armed, and under the command of Mr.
Roberts; the launch was also ordered to
assist his own boat. He landed with the
marines at the upper end of the town of
Kavoroah, where the natives received him
with their accustomed tokens of respect, and
not the smallest sign of hostility was evinced
by any of them; and as the crowds increased,
the chiefs employed themselves as before, in
keeping order. Captain Cook requested the
King to go on board the <i>Resolution</i> with
him, to which he offered few objections;
but in a little time it was observed that the
natives were arming themselves with long
spears, clubs, and daggers, and putting on
the thick mats which they used by way of
armor. This hostile appearance was increased
by the arrival of a canoe from the opposite
side of the bay, announcing that one of the
chiefs had been killed by a shot from the
<i>Discovery&#8217;s</i> boat. The women, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
been conversing familiarly with the English,
immediately retired, and loud murmurs arose
amongst the crowd. Captain Cook, perceiving
the tumultuous proceedings of the natives,
ordered Lieutenant Middleton to march
his marines down to the boats, to which the
islanders offered no obstruction. The captain
followed with the king, attended by
his wife, two sons, and several chiefs. One
of the sons had already entered the pinnace,
expecting his father to follow, when the
king&#8217;s wife and others hung round his neck,
and forced him to be seated near a double
canoe, assuring him that he would be put to
death if he went on board the ship.
</p>
<p>Whilst matters were in this position, one
of the chiefs was seen with a dagger partly
concealed under his cloak, lurking about
Captain Cook, and the lieutenant of marines
proposed to fire at him; but this the captain
would not permit; but the chief closing upon
them, the officer of marines struck him with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
his firelock. Another native, grasping the
sergeant&#8217;s musket, was forced to let it go by
a blow from the lieutenant. Captain Cook,
seeing the tumult was increasing, observed,
that &#8220;if he were to force the king off, it
could only be done by sacrificing the lives
of many of his people;&#8221; and was about
to give orders to re-embark, when a man
flung a stone at him, which he returned by
discharging small-shot from one of the barrels
of his piece. The man was but little
hurt; and brandishing his spear, with threatenings
to hurl it at the captain, the latter,
unwilling to fire with ball, knocked the fellow
down, and then warmly expostulated
with the crowd for their hostile conduct.
At this moment a man was observed behind
a double canoe, in the act of darting a spear
at Captain Cook, who promptly fired, but
killed another who was standing by his side.
The sergeant of marines, however, instantly
presented, and brought down the native
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
whom the captain had missed. The impetuosity
of the islanders was somewhat repressed;
but being pushed on by those in
the rear, who were ignorant of what was
passing in front, a volley of stones was
poured in amongst the marines, who, without
waiting for orders, returned it with a
general discharge of musketry, which was
directly succeeded by a brisk fire from the
boats. Captain Cook expressed much surprise
and vexation; he waved his hand for
the boats to cease firing, and to come on
shore to embark the marines. The pinnace
unhesitatingly obeyed; but the lieutenant in
the launch, instead of pulling in to the assistance
of his commander, rowed further off
at the very moment that the services of himself
and people were most required. Nor
was this all the mischief that ensued; for,
as it devolved upon the pinnace to receive
the marines, she became so crowded, as to
render the men incapable of using their fire-arms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
The marines on shore, however,
fired; but the moment their pieces were
discharged, the islanders rushed <i>en masse</i>
upon them, forced the party into the water,
where four of them were killed, and the
lieutenant wounded. At this critical period
Captain Cook was left entirely alone upon a
rock near the shore. He, however, hurried
towards the pinnace, holding his left arm
round the back of his head, to shield it from
the stones, and carrying his musket under
his right. An islander, armed with a club,
was seen in a crouching posture cautiously
following him, as if watching for an opportunity
to spring forward upon his victim.
This man was a relation of the king&#8217;s, and
remarkably agile and quick. At length, he
jumped forward upon the captain, and struck
him a heavy blow on the back of his head,
and then turned and fled. The captain appeared
to be somewhat stunned: he staggered
a few paces, and, dropping his musket,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
fell on his hands and one knee; but whilst
striving to recover his upright position,
another islander rushed forward, and with
an iron dagger stabbed him in the neck.
He again made an effort to proceed, but fell
into a small pool of water not more than
knee-deep, and numbers instantly ran to the
spot, and endeavored to keep him down;
but by his struggles he was enabled to get
his head above the surface, and casting a
look towards the pinnace (then not more
than five or six yards distant), seemed to be
imploring assistance. It is asserted that, in
consequence of the crowded state of the
pinnace, (through the withdrawal of the
launch), the crew of the boat were unable to
render any aid; but it is also probable that
the emergency of this unexpected catastrophe
deprived the English of that cool judgment
which was requisite on such an occasion.
The islanders, perceiving that no help was
afforded, forced him under water again, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
in a deeper place; yet his great muscular
power once more enabled him to raise himself
and cling to the rock. At this moment
a forcible blow was given with a club, and
he fell down lifeless. The savages then
hauled his corpse upon the rock, and ferociously
stabbed the body all over, snatching
the dagger from each others&#8217; hands to wreak
their sanguinary vengeance on the slain.
The body was left some time exposed upon
the rock; and as the islanders gave way,
through terror at their own act and the fire
from the boats, it might have been recovered
entire. But no attempt of the kind was
made; and it was afterwards, together with
the marines, cut up, and the parts distributed
amongst the chiefs. The mutilated
fragments were subsequently restored, and
committed to the deep with all the honors
due to the rank of the deceased. Thus,
February 14, 1779, perished in an inglorious
brawl with a set of savages, one of England&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
greatest navigators, whose services
to science have never been surpassed by any
man belonging to his profession. It may
almost be said that he fell a victim to his
humanity; for if, instead of retreating before
his barbarous pursuers, with a view to spare
their lives, he had turned revengefully upon
them, his fate might have been very different.
</p>
<p>The death of their commander was felt to
be a heavy blow by the officers and seamen
of the expedition. With deep sorrow the
ships&#8217; companies left Owyhee, where the
catastrophe had occurred, the command of
the <i>Resolution</i> devolving on Captain Clerke,
and Mr. Gore acting as commander of the
<i>Discovery</i>. After making some further exploratory
searches among the Sandwich
Islands, the vessels visited Kamtschatka and
Behring&#8217;s Strait. Here it was found impossible
to penetrate through the ice either
on the coast of America or that of Asia, so
that they returned to the southward; and on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
August 22, 1779, Captain Clerke died of
consumption, and was succeeded by Captain
Gore, who, in his turn, gave Lieutenant King
an acting order in the <i>Discovery</i>. After a
second visit to Kamtschatka, the two ships
returned by way of China, remained some
time at Canton, touched at the Cape, and
arrived at the Nore, October 4, 1780, after
an absence of four years, two months, and
twenty-two days, during which the <i>Resolution</i>
lost only five men by sickness, and the
<i>Discovery</i> did not lose a single man.
</p>
<p>By this, as well as the preceding voyages
of Cook, a considerable addition was made
to a knowledge of the earth&#8217;s surface. Besides
clearing up doubts respecting the
Southern Ocean, and making known many
islands in the Pacific, the navigator did an
inestimable service to his country in visiting
the coasts of New South Wales, Van Diemen&#8217;s
Land, New Zealand, and Norfolk
Island&mdash;all now colonial possessions of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Britain, and rapidly becoming the seat of a
large and flourishing nation of Anglo-Australians&mdash;the
England of the southern
hemisphere.
</p>
<p>The intelligence of Captain Cook&#8217;s death
was received with melancholy regrets in
England. The king granted a pension of
£200 per annum to his widow, and £25 per
annum to each of the children; the Royal
Society had a gold medal struck in commemoration
of him; and various other honors
at home and abroad were paid to his
memory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, by his own persevering efforts,&#8221;
as has been well observed by the author of
the &#8216;Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties,&#8217;
&#8220;did this great man raise himself
from the lowest obscurity to a reputation
wide as the world itself, and certain to last
as long as the age in which he flourished
shall be remembered by history. But better
still than even all this fame&mdash;than either the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
honors which he received while living, or
those which, when he was no more, his
country and mankind bestowed upon his
memory&mdash;he had exalted himself in the scale
of moral and intellectual being; had won a
new and nobler nature, and taken a high
place among the instructors and benefactors
of mankind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Honor and fame are not to be achieved
by seeking for them alone, nor are their
possession the end and aim of human existence.
It is only by an unwearied striving
after a new and nobler nature; only by being
useful to our fellows, and making the
most of those qualities of mind which God
has given us, that happiness is to be attained,
or that we fulfill the ends of our being.

Boston: D. Lothrop &amp; Co. $1.25.
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>&#8220;In this fresh little story, which is addressed especially to
young girls, the author tries to impress the lesson that the
disagreeable and annoying duties of life may be made pleasant
by accepting them as inevitable, and asking help from
above. Mrs. Prior is the widow of a clergyman, and has
been left with five little ones to support. She discharges her
servant, and divides the lighter duties of the household
between herself and the two eldest of her children, Minnie
and Helen. Unaccustomed to any thing but study and play,
the girls find it very hard to have their old time appointments
for enjoyment circumscribed, and complain bitterly at first.
The book gives a history of their experience, and shows how
the work that was so irksome at first became in the end a
source of pleasure and means of healthful discipline.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Six Months at Mrs. Prior&#8217;s&#8221; is a sweet story of womanly
tact combined with Christian trust. A widow, with scanty
means, makes a home happy for a group of children, restless,
wayward and aspiring, like many American children of our
day. The mother&#8217;s love holds them, her thrift cares for
them, her firmness restrains, and her christian words and
life win them to noble aims and living. The influence of the
christian household is widely felt, and the quiet transforming
leaven works in many homes. We can&#8217;t have too many
books of this kind in the family or Sunday-school.&#8221;

and shows how an humble woman, with a Christian character
which gave power to her words, raised the money to pay
off a debt which had long been a hindrance to church growth
and to Christian benevolence. Why she did it, and how she
did it, is told in Pansy&#8217;s best fashion: her encounters with
crabbed folks, and stingy folks, and folks determined not to
give to the church debt, are highly amusing, as well as her
devices to get something from everybody.

</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>Of the many good books
which the Messrs. Lothrop have prepared for the shelves of
Sunday-school libraries, &#8220;Yensie Walton&#8221; is one of the
best. It is a sweet, pure story of girl life, quiet as the flow
of a brook, and yet of sufficient interest to hold the attention
of the most careless reader. Yensie is an orphan, who has
found a home with an uncle, a farmer, some distance from
the city. Her aunt, a coarse, vulgar woman, and a tyrant
in the household, does her best to humiliate her by making
her a domestic drudge, taking away her good clothing and
exchanging it for coarse, ill-filling garments, and scolding
her from morning till night. This treatment develops a
spirit of resistance; the mild and affectionate little girl becomes
passionate and disobedient, and the house is the
scene of continual quarrels. Fortunately, her uncle insists
upon her attending school, and in the teacher, Miss Gray,
she finds her first real friend. In making her acquaintance
a new life begins for her. She is brought in contact with
new and better influences, and profiting by them becomes in
time a sunbeam in her uncle&#8217;s house, and the means of
softening the heart and quieting the tongue of the aunt who
was once her terror and dread. Mrs. Clark has a very pleasing
style, and is especially skilful in the construction of her
stories.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yensie Walton&#8221; is a story of great power, by a new
author. It aims to show that God uses a stern discipline to
form the noblest characters, and that the greatest trials of
life often prove the greatest blessings. The story is subordinate
to this moral aim, and the earnestness of the author
breaks out into occasional preaching. But the story is full
of striking incident and scenes of great pathos, with occasional
gleams of humor and fun by way of relief to the more
tragic parts of the narrative. The characters are strongly
drawn, and, in general, are thoroughly human, not gifted
with impossible perfections, but having those infirmities of
the flesh which make us all akin.

<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>Despite the efforts of publishers, a brilliant book for boys

appreciated by all lively boys between twelve and forty.
While in literary finish the book ranks with the best novels
of the day, the characters are the boys and girls of our modern
High Schools. The plot is of breathless interest, but of such
a character that we will warrant when the general mystification
is dispersed no reader will feel like ever undertaking to
seem what he is not. The humiliation which at last overtakes
Royal Lowrie and Archer Bishop is so very thorough
that the two gay, thoughtless fellows, in the language of the

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Baby Bunting</span>. Short Stories with Bright Pictures. By
the Best American Authors. Boston: D. Lothrop &amp; Co.
Price, $1.00.
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p><i>Baby Bunting</i> is a beautiful quarto with one of the most
attractive outsides we have seen for a long time. It is made
up of choice stories adapted to the reading of children from
four to eight years of age. They are all short, few of them
being over a page in length, and each is accompanied by a
full page engraving. It is just the kind of book that ought
to be popular, and undoubtedly will be.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Young Folks&#8217; History of Germany</span>. By Charlotte M.
Yonge. Boston: D. Lothrop &amp; Co. Price, $1.50.
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>This handsome volume is the first of a series, which will
include the principal countries of Europe, the succeeding
numbers of which will appear at brief intervals. Miss
Yonge, whose talents have been exerted in various directions
for the benefit of young readers, has been peculiarly successful
in this series, which has had a very large sale in Europe,
and deserves a like popularity here. It covers not only the
entire period of German civilization down to the present
time, but it gives an account of ancient Germany and its inhabitants
in times which might almost be called pre-historic.
The first chapters are explanatory of the German mythology,
and of the ancient methods of worship. The Nibelungen
Lied is described and its story told. The real history begins
about the year 496 A.D., at a time when the Franks were
the victorious race in Europe. From that time down to the
beginning of the present year the record is continuous. The
volume is profusely illustrated.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Happy Moods of Happy Children</span>. Original Poems.
By favorite American authors. Boston: D. Lothrop &amp;
Co. Price $1.00.
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>We venture to say that no publishing house in the country
will issue this season anything choicer in the way of a presentation
book of poems than this charming volume. The
poems it contains were written expressly for Mr. Lothrop,
and have never before been brought together in collected
form. Among the authors represented are Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps, Clara Doty Bates, Margaret G. Preston, Ella Farman,
Mrs. Platt, Harriet McEwen Kimball, Mary A. Lathbury,
Nora Perry, Mrs. L. C. Whiton, Celia Thaxter, Edgar Fawcett,
and many others. Although the volume is ostensibly
preferred for children, it is one which grown-up people will
equally enjoy. There are a score or more of illustrations,
most of them full-page, exquisitely drawn and engraved.

<p>YOUNG RICK. By <i>Julia A. Eastman</i>. Large 16mo. Twelve illustrations by Sol Eytinge. $1.50
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>A bright, fascinating story of a little boy who was both a blessing
and a bother.&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i>
</p>
<p>The most delightful book on the list for the children of the
family, being full of adventures and gay home scenes and merry
play-times. &#8220;Paty&#8221; would have done credit to Dickens in his
palmiest days. The strange glows and shadows of her character
are put in lovingly and lingeringly, with the pencil of a master.
Miss Margaret&#8217;s character of light is admirably drawn, while Aunt
Lesbia, Deacon Harkaway, Tom Dorrance, and the master and
mistress of Graythorpe poor-house are genuine &#8220;charcoal
sketches.&#8221;

<p>KITTY KENT'S TROUBLES. By <i>Julia A. Eastman</i>. 16mo. Illustrated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1&nbsp;50
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>&#8220;A delicious April-day style of book, sunshiny with smiles on
one page while the next is misty with tender tears. Almost every
type of American school-girl is here represented&mdash;the vain Helen
Dart, the beauty, Amy Searle, the ambitious, high bred, conservative
Anna Matson; but next to Kitty herself sunny little Pauline
Sedgewick will prove the general favorite. It is a story fully
calculated to win both girls and boys toward noble, royal ways of
doing little as well as great things. All teachers should feel an
interest in placing it in the hands of their pupils.&#8221;
